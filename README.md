# Overview
How can AI make it easier to assemble structured journalism articles? Machines are no substitute for the insight and creativity of a trained journalist. But perhaps AI can assist with simple tasks that remove tedium and make production easier. This team will attempt to build an AI capable of assisting a journalist in quickly producing structured journalism content.

# Key Team Skills
Collectively, the team must have the following skill:
1. MongoDB
1. Flask or Django
1. Heroku
1. GitHub CI/CD
1. Behavior trees
1. Postman

# Roles and Responsibilities
1. **(1) Content developer**-- Create Python functions that query MongoDB for the raw content needed for article production.
1. **(1) Bot developer**-- Work with structured-journalism experts to determine simple assistant tasks. Use Flask or Django to build behavior trees that can perform simple structured journalism assistant tasks. Expose the funcationality as APIs.
1. **(1) Platform and API developer**-- Automate deployment from GitHub to Heroku. Use Postman to build API test cases for the bot and to demonstrate working functionality.
