        "article": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s a beetle that can withstand bird pecks, animal stomps and even being rolled over by a Toyota Camry. Now scientists are studying what the bug\u2019s crush-resistant shell could teach them about designing stronger planes and buildings.\n\n\u201cThis beetle is super tough,\u201d said Purdue University civil engineer Pablo Zavattieri, who was among a group of researchers that ran over the insect with a car as part of a new study.\n\nSo, how does the seemingly indestructible insect do it? The species \u2014 aptly named diabolical ironclad beetle \u2014 owes its might to an unusual armor that is layered and pieced together like a jigsaw, according to the study by Zavattieri and his colleagues published in Nature on Wednesday. And its design, they say, could help inspire more durable structures and vehicles.\n\nTo understand what gives the inch-long beetle its strength, researchers first tested how much squishing it could take. The species, which can be found in Southern California\u2019s woodlands, withstood compression of about 39,000 times its own weight.\n\nFor a 200-pound man, that would be like surviving a 7.8-million-pound crush.\n\nOther local beetle species shattered under one-third as much pressure.\n\nResearchers then used electron microscopes and CT scans to examine the beetle\u2019s exoskeleton and figure out what made it so strong.\n\nAs is often the case for flightless beetles, the species\u2019 elytra \u2014 a protective case that normally sheaths wings \u2014 had strengthened and toughened over time. Up close , scientists realized this cover also benefited from special, jigsaw-like bindings and a layered architecture.\n\nWhen compressed, they found the structure fractured slowly instead of snapping all at once.\n\n\u201cWhen you pull them apart,\u201d Zavattieri said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t break catastrophically. It just deforms a little bit. That\u2019s crucial for the beetle.\u201d\n\nIt could also be useful for engineers who design aircraft and other vehicles with a variety of materials such as steel, plastic and plaster. Currently, engineers rely on pins, bolts, welding and adhesives to hold everything together. But those techniques can be prone to degrading.\n\nIn the structure of the beetle\u2019s shell, nature offers an \u201cinteresting and elegant\u201d alternative, Zavattieri said.\n\nBecause the beetle-inspired design fractures in a gradual and predictable way, cracks could be more reliably inspected for safety, said Po-Yu Chen, an engineer at Taiwan\u2019s National Tsing Hua University not involved in the research.\n\nThe beetle study is part of an $8 million project funded by the U.S. Air Force to explore how the biology of creatures such as mantis shrimp and bighorn sheep could help develop impact-resistant materials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to go beyond what nature has done,\u201d said study co-author David Kisailus, a materials scientist and engineer at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nThe research is the latest effort to borrow from the natural world to solve human problems, said Brown University evolutionary biologist Colin Donihue, who was not involved in the study. Velcro, for example, was inspired by the hook-like structure of plant burrs. Artificial adhesives took a page from super-clingy gecko feet.\n\nDonihue said endless other traits found in nature could offer insight: \u201cThese are adaptations that have evolved over millennia.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Marion Renault on Twitter: @MarionRenault\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

        "article": "Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett repeatedly dodged questions about the scientific reality of climate change during her Senate confirmation hearing last week, and questions asked away from live cameras offered little more clarity.\n\nIn written responses submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee and released Tuesday night, Barrett, 48, refused to answer questions about her father\u2019s ties to the American Petroleum Institute, the nation\u2019s largest and most powerful oil and gas lobby.\n\nBarrett\u2019s father, Mike Coney, is a Catholic deacon and attorney who worked for Royal Dutch Shell for decades. For more than 20 years, he was also an \u201cactive member of The American Petroleum Institute Subcommittee of Exploration and Production Law\u201d and twice served as its chairman, according to a biography on his law firm website.\n\nA recusal list Barrett submitted as part of her job on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit mentions Shell seven times; however, it does not list API, which spent more than $6.6 million lobbying last year alone.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Barrett in writing if her father\u2019s leadership role at API required her to recuse herself from cases involving the trade group. Barrett referred Durbin to her answer to a previous question about whether there are any other energy companies she must recuse herself from.\n\nSTEFANI REYNOLDS via Getty Images Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump's nominee for Supreme Court, is staying silent on her familial ties to the American Petroleum Institute.\n\n\u201cThe question of recusal is a threshold question of law that must be addressed in the context of the facts of each case,\u201d Barrett wrote in her response. \u201cAs Justice Ginsburg described the process that Supreme Court justices go through in deciding whether to recuse, it involves reading the statute, reviewing precedents, and consulting with colleagues. As a sitting judge and as a judicial nominee, it would not be appropriate for me to offer an opinion on abstract legal issues or hypotheticals. Such questions can only be answered through the judicial process.\u201d\n\nThat answer stands in contrast to her written response about cases involving Shell and its affiliates.\n\n\u201cMy father worked at Shell Oil Company for many years, and while on the Seventh Circuit, in an abundance of caution, I have recused myself from cases involving those Shell entities with which he was involved,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAPI wields tremendous influence over policymaking at the federal and state level and markets the industry directly to consumers. Earlier this month, the group released a series of new TV ads that paint a misleading picture of the most recent science on emissions from natural gas.\n\nThe organization has been peddling climate misinformation for decades. In 1998, API hatched plans for a multiyear, multimillion dollar campaign to sow doubt about the threat of climate change, including developing a media kit with research papers that \u201cundercut the \u2018conventional wisdom\u2019 on climate science,\u201d as detailed in a new infamous memo.\n\n\u201cConey Barrett\u2019s corporate activism and bent are well-documented, but her nonanswers on these serious conflicts of interest involving one [of] the largest big oil corporations in the world and one of their dirty lobby associations tell us everything we need to know about her climate denial,\u201d Jayson O\u2019Neill, a spokesperson for the watchdog group Accountable.US, told HuffPost in an email. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s clearly disqualifying.\u201d",

        "article": "As record numbers of fires scorched the Amazon rainforest during each of the past two summers, far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro knew where to turn for refuge from international scorn: the United States. President Donald Trump is an ideological ally and one of the few world leaders whose climate skepticism matches Bolsonaro\u2019s own.\n\nAt the first presidential debate in early October, however, Democratic nominee Joe Biden made clear that if he were to defeat Trump in November\u2019s election, the U.S. government would no longer sympathize with climate change denial. Biden said he would create a $20 billion international fund to incentivize Brazil to stop tearing down the Amazon. If Bolsonaro rejected the plan, Biden said, Brazil would face \u201ceconomic consequences.\u201d\n\nThe proposal wasn\u2019t new, but this time it drew Bolsonaro\u2019s ire. Brazil \u201cdoes not accept bribes,\u201d he said in a statement posted to Twitter and Facebook. Biden\u2019s statement, Bolsonaro said, was \u201ca clear sign of contempt for cordial and fruitful coexistence between two sovereign nations.\u201d\n\nFor months, Biden has insisted that climate change will feature prominently in his agenda at home and abroad. Choosing Brazil as his go-to example of Trump\u2019s failure on the world stage was perhaps the clearest indication yet that he intends to follow through on that pledge.\n\nAnd should he win, Biden is unlikely to back down in the face of Bolsonaro\u2019s anger. Few countries are more important to the fight for planetary survival than Brazil: Preservation of the Amazon rainforest is one of the simplest ways to reduce carbon emissions and limit the rise of global temperatures. From 2004 to 2014, for instance, Brazil\u2019s successful efforts to limit deforestation in the Amazon were almost solely responsible for global emissions reductions. Without Brazil on board, Biden\u2019s efforts to make international progress on climate won\u2019t accomplish much even if he makes the U.S. as bold and forward-thinking as it should have been long ago. His climate agenda depends not only on his own ambition but on his ability to alter Brazil and Bolsonaro\u2019s too.\n\n\u201cIn any relationship that Joe Biden has with leaders around the world, climate change will be at the top of that agenda, and that includes Brazil,\u201d said Juan Gonzalez, a longtime Latin America adviser to Biden who served as a deputy assistant secretary of state in the Obama administration. \u201cAnybody, in Brazil or elsewhere, who thinks they can advance an ambitious relationship with the United States while ignoring important issues like climate change, democracy, and human rights clearly hasn\u2019t been listening to Joe Biden on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nRisking Pariah Status\n\nThanks in large part to the countries\u2019 shared economic interests, the U.S.-Brazil relationship has remained strong, if often overlooked, even during times of deep ideological differences and occasional chills. As vice president, Biden played a central role in that relationship at one of its modern low points. Following 2015 revelations that the U.S. had spied on its South American neighbor, President Barack Obama sent Biden to repair relations with Brazil\u2019s then-leader, Dilma Rousseff.\n\nGetty Images Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro (right) rejected Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's pledge to raise $20 billion in international funds to help Brazil protect the Amazon rainforest, which has suffered record outbreaks of fires over the last two years.\n\nBiden\u2019s history with Brazil and his fairly conventional approach to foreign policy have left some officials within Bolsonaro\u2019s government thinking that not much would change under a Democratic White House. When the U.S. and Brazil reached an agreement on a small trade deal this week, for instance, former Brazilian Trade Secretary Welber Barral said it was the type of economic agreement that would pass \u201ceven in an eventual Joe Biden government.\u201d\n\nBut that may underestimate how seriously a Biden administration would take climate change, and Bolsonaro could find himself quickly isolated on the global stage if, alongside the U.S., he doesn\u2019t move closer to the international consensus on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt would be a mistake to assume that we were somehow going to give Brazil a pass on important issues,\u201d said Thomas Shannon, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Brazil under President Obama. \u201cBiden signaled one of them, which is the Amazon \u2015 and deforestation\u2019s impact on biodiversity and the climate.\u201d\n\nU.S. politics have shifted, Shannon said, in ways that Bolsonaro\u2019s close relationship with Trump may have shielded him from so far. Biden\u2019s climate agenda, and the central role of the Amazon in it, is a reflection not just of his own priorities but of the Democratic Party\u2019s.\n\nClimate has become a more prominent issue for Democrats in Congress and among their base of voters across the country over the last four years. At the same time, Bolsonaro\u2019s ties to Trump and the perception that his efforts to roll back environmental regulations worsened the outbreak of fires in the Amazon have made him a lightning rod among an increasingly large share of Democratic lawmakers and officials in Washington. (The Brazilian leader\u2019s rhetoric on social issues and his anti-democratic actions haven\u2019t helped, either.)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just been awful,\u201d Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) told HuffPost this summer, a sentiment that some progressives have shared since the start of Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency but that has intensified on Capitol Hill in the two years since. \u201cI think, as in so many situations around the world or at home, when you get layers of evidence piled upon one another, people begin to pay attention.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and Brazil have a significant trade relationship, and Bolsonaro has sought to expand that economic partnership to Brazil\u2019s benefit. Although he won Trump\u2019s support for Brazil\u2019s entry into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Bolsonaro has not been able to move forward on another major goal: a new trade deal with the United States that goes far beyond the smaller agreement the two countries reached this week.\n\nThere\u2019s always been illegal logging in the Amazon, there\u2019s been spotty enforcement, there\u2019s been a push for development. But [Bolsonaro] has put all these policies on steroids. U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer\n\nBolsonaro interpreted Biden\u2019s mention of \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d as a threat of broad sanctions, but it\u2019s more likely that Biden simply won\u2019t make Brazil\u2019s economic goals a priority without clear commitments on climate.\n\nThat\u2019s a position at least some congressional Democrats may already hold. In June, a group of House Democrats, including Beyer, signed onto a letter opposing any new trade deal with Brazil \u2015 a move that was driven largely by concerns about Bolsonaro\u2019s environmental and human rights record, said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s subcommittee on trade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been illegal logging in the Amazon, there\u2019s been spotty enforcement, there\u2019s been a push for development,\u201d Blumenauer told HuffPost in June, not long after the lawmakers sent their letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. \u201cBut [Bolsonaro] has put all these policies on steroids.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an assault on the global environment,\u201d Blumenauer said, adding that he was also alarmed by Bolsonaro\u2019s policies toward Indigenous Brazilians and environmentalists who opposed his government. \u201cIt is a pretty ruthless regime. Why would we want to facilitate them economically?\u201d\n\nPolitical Pressure At Home\n\nIf Biden wins, both he and Bolsonaro will face significant domestic pressure to act more urgently on climate change.\n\nIn the U.S., Biden\u2019s relative aggression on the issue is, in part, a response to the progressive push to do more. That will likely only intensify if he\u2019s in the White House, given that progressive groups are already skeptical that he will appoint the sort of climate-focused officials they want to see in key Cabinet positions.\n\nProgressives will demand that Biden and congressional Democrats who prioritize trade over environmental concerns take a harder line against Bolsonaro, said Andrew Miller, the advocacy director at Amazon Watch, which has brought Brazilian Indigenous leaders and environmental activists to Congress to raise awareness about their right-wing president.\n\nBolsonaro, meanwhile, has faced his own internal pushback from environmental groups and Indigenous organizations, although he rarely pays them much mind. Key actors in Brazil\u2019s influential agribusiness and financial sectors have also pressured him to change course, amid fears that his anti-environment reputation harms Brazil\u2019s ability to attract vital foreign investment and threatens trade relationships with Europe. That pressure, too, will likely increase if Biden wins the White House and makes climate a priority.\n\nAt the same time, substantial portions of the Brazilian state, including Bolsonaro, regard international demands on climate as misdirected and even devious.\n\nAP Photo/Eraldo Peres A woman holds a sign reading \"Climate Justice Now!\" during a protest against Bolsonaro's environmental policies in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia. Bolsonaro has faced domestic and international pressure to alter his approach to the environment.\n\nA former Army captain, Bolsonaro has leaned heavily into the idea that international efforts to protect the Amazon rainforest are a colonialist plot to gain control of the country\u2019s resources, an idea that first became prominent during the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. In 2019, as fires raged across the Amazon, Bolsonaro denied they were occurring in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly. His top diplomat, Ernesto Araujo, has denied the existence of climate change, and Bolsonaro has taken a combative public stance against world leaders, like France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, who have pushed him to change course.\n\nInside Bolsonaro\u2019s government, there is a belief that Brazil has become an international scapegoat thanks to misperceptions, half-truths and historical amnesia. Amid scrutiny over the fires, officials have argued that Brazil has protected more of its land than the U.S. or any of the European countries that criticize it and has done more to shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources.\n\nAlthough deforestation rates have spiked under Bolsonaro, the current increases began before he took office. The president has pointed to his mobilization of the military to combat fires in the Amazon and the Pantanal, Brazil\u2019s vast wetland savanna that also burned at record rates this year, as evidence that he\u2019s not ignoring the country\u2019s environmental challenges but confronting them.\n\nBrazilians point out that, unlike the U.S. under Trump, their country has not left the Paris climate accords. There is frustration that developed nations like France, Germany and the U.S. have not matched their words about climate with action or followed through on commitments they made to Brazil and other developing countries \u2015 not just under the Paris agreement, but dating back to the Kyoto Protocol of 1992.\n\nEnvironmental minister Ricardo Salles has argued for two years that wealthy countries that long ago destroyed their own environments have little standing to chastise Brazil now for pursuing its economic interests on its own terms. Last year, Brazil rejected environmental aid packages from the G-7 countries.\n\nStill, Brazilian officials insist their country is prepared to partner with others on climate-related issues if those countries are ready to take action instead of solely demanding it from elsewhere.\n\nAnd there will be significant pressure to do so. The Bolsonaro-Trump alliance has also helped Brazilian and U.S. environmental activists forge closer partnerships. They are likely to continue pressing legislators in both governments.\n\nDrew Angerer via Getty Images Biden has campaigned on climate change and environmentalism, but he'll likely still face pressure from U.S. progressives, who have demanded that he act aggressively should he win November's election.\n\nHow that pressure \u201caffects the U.S.-Brazil relationship will in many ways depend on how skillful Brazil and Bolsonaro are in dealing with this [diplomatically],\u201d Shannon said. \u201cSo far they have not shown themselves to be skillful. They have shown that they\u2019re defensive, resentful and suspicious.\u201d\n\nThe Bolsonaro government will likely be willing to talk climate with a Biden administration and even make some changes in an effort to foster stronger relations, said Ricardo Mendes, a Brazilian international consultant, at a discussion hosted by the Woodrow Wilson Center earlier this month in Washington. But it will be difficult, he added, to reconcile the key difference between the Bolsonaro government and its chief environmental critics: The former sees the Amazon as key to Brazil\u2019s own development, while the latter views its preservation as vital to the planet\u2019s survival.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not talking about the same things,\u201d Mendes said at the event. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a PR problem, it\u2019s not something that will just go away by replacing ministers, it\u2019s not something that will just go away by controlling the fires. It\u2019s a different mindset on what needs to be done on the Amazon.\u201d\n\nWhat An Aggressive Plan Looks Like\n\nBiden hasn\u2019t specified what pressure on Brazil might look like, but activists and environmental organizations have ideas. A Biden administration could take aggressive steps to bar imports of products from illegally deforested lands, something that Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) has already proposed. That would put intense pressure on agribusiness giants and food companies, as is the case in France, where supermarket chain Casino Group is facing potential penalties and lawsuits from environmental groups over its sale of meat from animals raised on cleared land in the Amazon.\n\nInvestors are another potential pressure point. The Securities and Exchange Commission could make new rules requiring Wall Street titans like BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase to account for environmentally destructive investments. Curbing U.S. incentives to make biofuels, such as corn-based ethanol, could also encourage Brazilian regulators to stop opening up more land to make sugar-based fuels.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration could do a lot more domestically and frame that in terms of a call to arms or a challenge to Bolsonaro to match what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Sarah Lake, the Latin America director at the environmental campaign group Mighty Earth. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for Biden to pressure companies and create regulation that requires much stricter environmental standards, even for portions of businesses that operate internationally.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no time to waste, groups like Mighty Earth argue. Scientists have issued dire warnings about the fate of the Amazon if nothing is done now. As much as 40% of the rainforest, a recent study found, is near the \u201ctipping point\u201d that will turn it into savanna. That\u2019s a loss that would be nearly impossible to reverse \u2015 and that would further imperil the international fight against climate change, even if Biden acts with the sort of resolve that\u2019s long been lacking in the United States.",

        "article": "IOLA, Wis. (AP) \u2014 They wrote it right into their business plan -\u2013 an expectation that, each year, at least half the stock on which their livelihood depends would die.\n\nBuilding a business around bees is not for the faint-hearted. \u201cYou have to be a little crazy,\u201d says James Cook, who, with wife Samantha Jones, started beekeeping eight years ago. They knew well the challenges their bees face \u2013- parasites and the impact of pesticides among them.\n\nEven so, they were hopeful. 2020 was to be their year to go off on their own, after working several years for another beekeeper. They and their bees spent the past winter in California\u2019s massive almond orchards, full of white blossoms that turn into nuts, thanks to the many beekeepers who travel extensively with their hives to pollinate many of the nation\u2019s crops.\n\nThen the coronavirus hit and, for a moment, Cook and Jones panicked.\n\n\u201cDo we stay? Do we go?\u201d they asked each other. By that time, they had packed up their tent and trucked their hives from California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley to another temporary home in the state\u2019s foothills, where the bees could \u201cdetox\u201d from the agricultural work.\n\nThere, they raised \u201cnucs\u201d \u2014 hive starter-kits, of sorts, with new queens \u2014 which they sell to other beekeepers to replace bees that inevitably die over the course of a season. This work and the almond pollination each represent about a third of their business.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t want to get stuck in California\u2019s pandemic shutdown. The other third of their business was in their permanent base of Wisconsin, where they own a farmhouse and spend the summer honey season.\n\nDeemed essential agricultural workers in a line of work that\u2019s generally quite solitary, they decided to wait it out. Then they and the bees trekked back to Iola, Wisconsin. There, marshaling their 750 bee colonies, they would set out to create their brand, Bird and the Bees Honey.\n\nThe bird in the title is Kat, their free-ranging parrot who often rides in the cab of their truck and who also happens to like honey.\n\nThis summer, Cook and Jones and their small crew worked day and night to build an extraction and bottling facility out of old semi trailers.\n\nThey were exhausted and in debt, having taken on loans to get the business up and running \u2013 but also excited.\n\nJones, 38, noted how much of the honey available in grocery stores is blended and cooked. \u201cIt would lose all those fine, delicate flavors that honey has,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I thought that people deserved good honey.\u201d\n\nUnlike other agricultural crops, honey also can be stored indefinitely. That\u2019s fortunate since the pandemic has left them fewer outlets for sales; farmers\u2019 markets have been limited and restaurants and breweries have cut back, as well.\n\nCook, 35, says the experience of starting a business in these challenging times will make them more resilient.\n\n\u201cI think beekeeping sort of taught me (that) inside of this space of sheer chaos and uncertainty and fear and danger, in a lot of ways, you kind of need to look for the optimism and the beauty that you can find,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause otherwise, it\u2019s really hard to wake up in the morning.\u201d\n\n___",

        "article": "StanOd via Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability, a little goes a long way. We should ideally all be driving electric cars (or better yet, riding bikes) and eating fruits and vegetables grown in our own backyards, but eco-friendliness just doesn\u2019t come that easy.\n\nOf course, a couple hundred major companies are responsible for the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions. But as individuals, we can make a difference by adjusting our habits too. With that in mind, we\u2019ve highlighted eight things to do in your kitchen that will help the environment without disrupting life as you know it.\n\nWhether you pick up one or all of our suggestions, we applaud you: The world is a better place because of your open disposition.\n\n1. Sign up for a CSA program\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics: Community-supported agriculture (CSA) directly connects you \u2014 the consumer \u2014 to nearby farmers, giving you access to the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of local products, while reducing the carbon footprint involved in the transport of food across the country.\n\nYou\u2019ll subscribe to the harvest of a specific farm (or group of farms) and receive a delivery of seasonal products on a weekly (or sometimes monthly) basis. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the model allows the farmer to receive \u201cadvance working capital, gain financial security, earn better crop prices and benefit from the direct marketing plan.\u201d\n\nThere are usually long waitlists ahead of each season, so we suggest getting in contact with a nearby CSA program as soon as possible. Find a local CSA here by plugging in your zip code.\n\n2. Start composting\n\nComposting sounds more complicated than it is, and saving your food scraps allows you to recycle organic materials that, instead of becoming trash, will function as natural fertilizers used in gardening. By reducing your food waste, you\u2019ll also indirectly help combat climate change.\n\nCandle Photo via Getty Images Organic food waste like vegetable peelings and food leftovers can be turned into nutrient-rich soil for your garden.\n\nNot everything can be composted, of course (stay away from meat and dairy products), but the easiest way to kick off the effort is to collect eggshells, coffee grounds, discarded parts of fruits and veggies, and tea bags (among other things); store them in a bin separate from the rest of your trash; and deliver the container to a drop-off site. Google \u201ccomposting drop-off near [enter your city]\u201d to find the closest one to you.\n\nIf you want to do the actual composting yourself and only have space to do so indoors, consider investing in one of these small composters.\n\n3. Say no to disposable utensils\n\nThis is pretty straight-forward advice: When ordering takeout or delivery, ask the restaurant to hold the plastic utensils that usually come with your meal. Go a step further and invest in a nice set of utensils that you can leave at work or carry in your bag, allowing you to permanently stay away from single-use plastic, which is a big no-no.\n\nThis Shell and Turtle set includes a straw and chopsticks (always useful) and comes in a nice travel container, but if you\u2019re looking for something even simpler, check out this Joseph Joseph option \u2014 complete with a silicone carrying case, of course.\n\n4. Invest in biodegradable trash bags\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t get any easier than this: If you can\u2019t recycle or compost your waste, you can still do some good by lining your trash can with biodegradable bags, which are decomposed by bacteria or other living organisms. Basically, it\u2019s another way to limit our reliance on single-use plastic products that don\u2019t break down.\n\nThere is a slew of good options on Amazon and, if you want to go a step further, try using compostable trash bags, which are considered even greener than their biodegradable counterparts.\n\n5. Consider switching to a French press coffee routine\n\nYes, drinking coffee is a very personal experience based on a variety of just-as-personal factors. That being said, certain brewing methods are inherently less eco-friendly than others. Take coffee filters, for example: Using a new one for each batch is wasteful, but opting for a reusable one isn\u2019t as green of a choice as using a French press, which requires absolutely no filters or plastic. Easy, peasy. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to add those coffee grounds to the compost bin you started.\n\nWachiwit via Getty Images French press coffee makers don't require any paper filters.\n\n6. Use discarded citrus peels to make an all-purpose cleaner\n\nYou\u2019ll get double points for this one because you\u2019ll mitigate your waste while using a more natural cleaning product. Although there are a ton of easy-to-follow recipes for homemade natural cleaners online, all more or less share the same steps and ingredients, which are mainly citrus scraps and distilled white vinegar. We\u2019re particularly fond of this step-by-step guide given its simplicity, as well as Good Housekeeping\u2019s recommendation, which makes creative use of rosemary sprigs. (You should feel free to include any aromatic herb in your concoction to play around with its scent.)\n\nNo matter which recipe you choose to follow, you\u2019ll need a container to store the stuff and, as the true green citizen of the world that you are, try your best to avoid buying new plastic and either reuse a plastic spray bottle you have, or buy a glass one.\n\n7. Choose greener kitchen gadgets and tools\n\nFrom eco-friendly sponges made entirely of recycled materials (check this out) to using cloths instead of paper towels, there are a ton of substitutes that you can bring into your kitchen to make it more environmentally friendly.\n\nStart with the aforementioned paper towels: According to the Environmental Protection Agency, paper is the biggest type of waste produced by U.S. homes, and given that Americans go through 13 billion pounds of paper towels each year, any way to avoid the product goes a long way. Paper towels are recyclable until you use them \u2014 but you can actually compost the ones you use to clean up organic material (notably not those covered in grease or cleaning chemicals).\n\nIf you can\u2019t imagine living without paper towels but want to swap another kitchen tool, consider investing in cutting boards made of bamboo. The grass (yes, bamboo isn\u2019t wood) is fast-growing and considered a renewable resource. It also happens to be very strong, so you won\u2019t soon have to replace the product.\n\nIn general, try to keep in mind that there are always greener and more eco-friendly options out there, so do your research before buying anything.\n\n8. Bring your own reusable tote to the market\n\nMany states and cities now have laws banning plastic bags on the books, so you might already be used to bringing your own totes to the grocery store, but if you aren\u2019t, you should definitely get in the habit. Why? According to Waste Management, Inc., only 1% of used plastic bags are returned for recycling. In the United States, we use over 14 billion plastic shopping bags each year, which means a whole lot of those are ending up in landfills and oceans.",

        "article": "MANGARATIBA, Brazil (AP) \u2014 All the locals knew the island just west of Rio de Janeiro was teeming with cats. They left food and even brought tourists. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, and human support dried up, resulting in a gruesome scene witnessed by fishermen: a group of cats devouring others\u2019 corpses.\n\nFurtada Island, referred to widely as \u201cIsland of the Cats,\u201d is 20 minutes by motorboat from the city of Mangaratiba, at one extreme of Brazil\u2019s Green Coast, a vast swath of mountainous tropical forest and sandy coves dotted with hundreds of islands.\n\nAP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo A cat seen on a tree branch at the Furtada Island in Mangaratiba, Brazil, Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2020.\n\nOver the years, fishermen tossed fish guts and any unneeded catch onto the island, while other kind souls left bowls of water and store-bought cat food. That has helped the island\u2019s hundreds of residents stay fed, particularly the recently marooned cats that lack the skills of their wild-born brethren, which climb trees to raid birds\u2019 nests.\n\nWhen the pandemic forced people to quarantine, sunk tourism and shut restaurants that dish up seafood, boat traffic around the island fell sharply \u2014 and with it, the food and water deposited there.\n\nAP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo A cat sits on a rock overlooking the water on Furtada Island.\n\nLocals didn\u2019t realize the horror playing out on the island until the fishermen reported back in April.\n\n\u201cThe number of boats fell, the number of tourists, and we saw the condition of those animals on the island,\u201d said Jorge de Morais, 58, who works with a local group that rescues animals from abuse. \u201cSo we mobilized.\u201d\n\nHe and other volunteers asked local businesses for donations. In April, they started installing rudimentary food and water dispensers, made from PVC pipes, and now make weekly trips to restock them.\n\nAP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo Furtada Island cats eat food taken by volunteers and dispensed from PVC pipes.\n\nOn Tuesday, as cats milled about, de Morais and three others filled the dispensers on the small island, where thick vegetation spills down to meet a rocky shore.\n\n\u201cCats that are recently discarded, they\u2019re more sociable. You saw we can get close, pet them,\u201d said Joice Puchalski, the coordinator for the volunteer group. \u201cBut not the feral ones. They\u2019re all hidden, and you see them at night, because of their eyes.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 250 cats on the island trace their origins to a couple who were the only residents some two decades ago, Puchalski, 47, explained. They decamped, leaving behind their two cats to do what most creatures, left to their own devices on a deserted island, would do. As the cat population grew, people took notice, and some believed they\u2019d found a repository for an urban scourge: unwanted and stray cats.\n\nAP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo A cat shelter on Furtada Island.\n\nAuthorities are looking into ways to stop people from abandoning animals on the island.

        "article": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Andrew Orkin was taking a break from his evening jog to sit by Prospect Park Lake when he turned around and was startled to see a tangle of wriggling snakes.\n\n\u201cAnd quite a big pile \u2014 fully alive,\u201d said Orkin, a music composer who lives near the Brooklyn park.\n\nThey turned out to be eels that had escaped from one of two large plastic bags that split open as a man dragged them to the shoreline. After dumping the eels in the lake, the man walked away, explaining to bystanders that \u201cI just want to save lives.\u201d\n\nThe illegal release late last month became a curiosity on social media, but the dumping of exotic animals in urban parks isn\u2019t new. In cities across the country, nonnative birds, turtles, fish and lizards have settled into, and often disturbed, local ecosystems.\n\nNew Yorkers free thousands of non-native animals every year, many of them abandoned pets that quickly die. But others can survive, reproduce and end up causing lasting harm.\n\n\u201cPeople like animals and they sometimes think they\u2019re doing a good thing by letting them go,\u201d said Jason Munshi-South, urban ecologist at Fordham University. \u201cMost will die. Some will become a problem, and then there\u2019s no going back.\u201d\n\nNew York state and city officials say it\u2019s too soon to know how the eels in Prospect Park might affect local species. But based on photos taken by bystanders, officials identified them as swamp eels native to Southeast Asia like those that have been found in at least eight states.\n\nAP Photo/Mary Altaffer Asian swamp eels on display for sale at a market in the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan, Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2020.\n\nOnce introduced \u2014 often after being purchased at local live fish markets, officials say \u2014 the eels eat almost anything including plants, insects, crustaceans, frogs, turtles and other fish. And they could prey upon or compete with the park\u2019s native species for however long they survive, said Katrina Toal, deputy director of the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation\u2019s Wildlife Unit.\n\nThere are no plans to eradicate the eels. Since they\u2019re nocturnal and spend most of their time burrowed in the sediment of lakes, rivers and marshes, spotting and removing them from the lake could be impossible.\n\n\u201cThis kind of species is a little tricky. They\u2019re well hidden,\u201d Toal said. \u201cWe\u2019 re not going to go out there and try to trap any of them.\u201d\n\nWithout having witnessed the release, officials from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which is investigating the incident, could not specify the number of eels released last month. Bystanders described seeing more than 100 of them.\n\nDEC officials say they will look for swamp eels during the agency\u2019s next survey in the spring, but don\u2019t expect them to make it through the winter.\n\nHowever, said University of Toronto freshwater ecologist Nicholas Mandrak, \u201cEven if they don\u2019t survive, they could have negative short-term impacts.\u201d\n\nIf some Prospect Park transplants survive for a few years, climate change could feasibly warm up city waters enough to render them hospitable for swamp eels, Mandrak said.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t come to an immediate conclusion that because they\u2019re found in Asia they couldn\u2019t survive in New York City,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exotic species previously has shown up in western New York state\u2019s Hemlock and Canadice lakes in 2019 and Queens\u2019 Meadow Lake in 2017. Elsewhere, biologists have found Asian swamp eels in waterways in Hawaii, Georgia, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\nNew York City has a long history of people introducing exotic species into its parks.\n\nIn 1890, Shakespeare enthusiasts released a flock of about 60 European starlings in Central Park that grew into a current population of hundreds of millions nationwide that outcompete native birds, destroy crops and occasionally snarl jet engines.\n\nFor decades, pet Red-eared slider turtles have been abandoned in city ponds, creating a major nuisance that has crowded out local painted turtles and fueled green algae blooms.\n\nVoracious, sharp-toothed Northern snakehead fish \u2014 introduced by way of pet stores, live food markets and aquarium hobbyists across the U.S. \u2014 have been spotted in New York\u2019s Harlem Meer and Flushing Meadows Corona Park.\n\nAnd descendants of escaped or released monk parakeets and Italian wall lizards are scattered across the city\u2019s boroughs.\n\nThe eels are just the latest episode. \u201cThis is an unusual and eye-catching story,\u201d Toal said, \u201cbut something that happens far more often is people release one unwanted pet.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Marion Renault on Twitter: @MarionRenault\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

        "article": "The Trump administration this week abruptly rejected California\u2019s request for federal disaster relief funds to help residents affected by the Creek fire and a string of other devastating blazes that have ravaged the state.\n\nState officials received a rejection letter that gave no explanation for the rebuff, a spokesperson for the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services said Thursday. The state plans to appeal.\n\nThe Trump administration previously approved similar requests for other wildfires, though President Donald Trump has threatened to cut aid to the Democratic-led state for partisan reasons.\n\nOn Friday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which administers disaster funds, said the agency \u201cdetermined that the early September fires were not of such severity and magnitude to exceed the combined capabilities of the state, affected local governments, voluntary agencies and other responding federal agencies.\u201d\n\nYet by Friday afternoon, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), a Trump ally, claimed that the president had \u201ccommitted to reverse FEMA\u2019s decision to deny the request.\u201d\n\nTrump has routinely questioned the science behind California\u2019s worsening fires. Fires have become larger and more frequent in recent years, along with extreme heat and droughts, because of climate change, according to experts. But Trump has repeatedly denied the role of climate change.\n\n\u201cIt will start getting cooler. You just watch,\u201d Trump told state officials during a trip to survey fire damage last month. \u201cI don\u2019t think science knows, actually.\u201d\n\nTrump has also repeatedly blamed California Gov.

        "article": "TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Nearly a decade after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Japan\u2019s government has decided to release over one million tonnes of contaminated water into the sea, media reports said on Friday, with a formal announcement expected to be made later this month.\n\nThe decision is expected to rankle neighboring countries like South Korea, which has already stepped up radiation tests of food from Japan, and further devastate the fishing industry in Fukushima that has battled against such a move for years.\n\nThe disposal of contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi plant has been a longstanding problem for Japan as it proceeds with a decades-long decommissioning project. Nearly 1.2 million tonnes of contaminated water are currently stored in huge tanks at the facility.\n\nThe plant, run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc., suffered multiple nuclear meltdowns after a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nOn Friday, Japan\u2019s industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said no decision had been made on the disposal of the water yet, but the government aims to make one quickly.\n\n\u201cTo prevent any delays in the decommissioning process, we need to make a decision quickly,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nHe did not give any further details, including a time-frame.\n\nAP Photo/Jae C. Hong Nine years ago, on March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami destroyed key cooling functions at the plant, causing a meltdown that leaked a massive amount of radiation.\n\nThe Asahi newspaper reported that any such release is expected to take at around two years to prepare, as the site\u2019s irradiated water first needs to pass through a filtration process before it can be further diluted with seawater and finally released into the ocean.\n\nIn 2018, Tokyo Electric apologized after admitting its filtration systems had not removed all dangerous material from the water, collected from the cooling pipes used to keep fuel cores from melting when the plant was crippled.\n\nIt has said it plans to remove all radioactive particles from the water except tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is hard to separate and is considered to be relatively harmless.\n\nIt is common practice for nuclear plants around the world to release water that contains traces of tritium into the ocean.\n\nIn April, a team sent by the International Atomic Energy Agency to review contaminated water issues at the Fukushima site said the options for water disposal outlined by an advisory committee in Japan - vapor release and discharges to the sea \u2013 were both technically feasible. The IAEA said both options were used by operating nuclear plants.\n\nLast week, Japanese fish industry representatives urged the government to not allow the release of contaminated water from the Fukushima plant into the sea, saying it would undo years of work to restore their reputation.\n\nSouth Korea has retained a ban on imports of seafood from the Fukushima region that was imposed after the nuclear disaster and summoned a senior Japanese embassy official last year to explain how Tokyo planned to deal with the Fukushima water problem.\n\nDuring Tokyo\u2019s bid to host the Olympic Games in 2013, then-prime minister Shinzo Abe told members of the International Olympic Committee that the Fukushima facility was \u201cunder control\u201d.\n\nThe Games have been delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic and some events are due to be held as close as 60 km (35 miles) from the wrecked plant.",

Strong winds fanned two Rocky Mountain wildfires Wednesday, prompting new evacuation orders as one of them spread toward communities that lie outside Rocky Mountain National Park (Bethany Baker/Fort Collins Coloradoan via AP)\n\nCHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 Strong winds fanned two Rocky Mountain wildfires Wednesday, prompting new evacuation orders as one spread toward communities outside Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nCool autumn weather had been helping firefighters in their efforts to quell the Mullen Fire in southeastern Wyoming and northern Colorado, and the Cameron Peak Fire in northern Colorado. But gusts of 70 mph (110 kilometers per hour) have complicated their efforts.\n\nForecasters expected dry air and strong wind to pose a challenge for firefighters into the weekend.\n\nThe fierce burning is occurring much later in the year than usual. Mountain snows usually are significant enough to end fire season well before mid-October.\n\nThe latest evacuations in the path of the Cameron Peak Fire affected mainly recreational properties \u2014 including hundreds of mountain cabins \u2014 in and around the communities of Glen Haven and Drake east of Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nThe fire continued spreading into remote northern Rocky Mountain National Park and was bearing down on the Colorado State University Mountain Campus a few miles (5 kilometers) north of the park.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing to do whatever is necessary in those areas,\u201d fire operations trainee Tim Daly said in a briefing about the efforts to protect the campus and communities.\n\nThe main route to the park from the east, U.S. Highway 34, remained open but under a voluntary evacuation notice, meaning people who need extra time to leave their homes along the highway should consider doing so.\n\nMandatory evacuation zones for the first time extended to the foothills just west of Fort Collins, Colorado. The city of 168,000 people on the edge of the plains wasn\u2019t considered at risk but residents awoke Wednesday to thick smoke and poor air quality alerts.\n\nFort Collins schools kept children indoors at recess and told parents that switching entirely to online teaching was an option if the smoke continued. Students already were being taught online part of the week due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt more than 210 square miles (540 square kilometers), the Cameron Peak Fire was less than 10 square miles (16 square kilometers) from becoming the biggest in Colorado history. Firefighters fully contained the state\u2019s biggest in history, the Pine Gulch Fire north of Grand Junction, on Sept. 15.\n\nThe Cameron Peak Fire has damaged or destroyed 95 buildings, including 33 homes, while the Mullen Fire 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the north in Medicine Bow National Forest has destroyed or damaged 65 structures. Both fires affected primarily recreational subdivisions and isolated cabins, not cities or towns.\n\nFirefighters planned to focus on holding their ground against the 275-square mile (700-square-kilometer) Mullen Fire, which was 34% contained, despite the gusty winds, fire operations section chief John Wallace said in a live-streamed public briefing Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blowing debris out there, a lot of ash blowing around. So the conditions are really nasty for us,\u201d Wallace said.\n\nCrews were preparing to study how to reseed trees and prevent future erosion from happening in the burned areas, some of which were beginning to reopen to homeowners.",

        "article": "SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Wildfires churning out dense plumes of smoke as they scorch huge swaths of the U.S. West Coast have exposed millions of people to hazardous pollution levels, causing emergency room visits to spike and potentially thousands of deaths among the elderly and infirm, according to an Associated Press analysis of pollution data and interviews with physicians, health authorities and researchers.\n\nSmoke at concentrations that topped the government\u2019s charts for health risks and lasted at least a day enshrouded counties inhabited by more than 8 million people across five states in recent weeks, AP\u2019s analysis shows.\n\nMajor cities in Oregon, which has been especially hard hit, last month suffered the highest pollution levels they\u2019ve ever recorded when powerful winds supercharged fires that had been burning in remote areas and sent them hurtling to the edge of densely populated Portland.\n\nMedical complications began arising while communities were still enveloped in smoke, including hundreds of additional emergency room visits daily in Oregon, according to state health officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been brutal for me,\u201d said Barb Trout, a 64-year-old retiree living south of Portland in the Willamette Valley. She was twice taken to the emergency room by ambulance following severe asthmatic reactions, something that had never happened to her before.\n\nTrout had sheltered inside as soon as smoke rolled into the valley just after Labor Day but within days had an asthma attack that left her gasping for air and landed her in the ER. Two weeks later, when smoke from fires in California drifted into the valley, she had an even more violent reaction that Trout described as a near-death experience.\n\nAP Photo/Andrew Selsky Barbara Trout, who has an asthma disorder, holds a vial of inhalation solution of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate, prescribed medication at her home in Keizer, Ore., on Oct. 14, 2020.\n\n\u201cIt hit me quick and hard __ more so than the first one. I wasn\u2019t hardly even breathing,\u201d she recalled. After getting stabilized with drugs, Trout was sent home but the specter of a third attack now haunts her. She and her husband installed an alarm system so she can press a panic button when in distress to call for help.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s put a whole new level on my life,\u2033 she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to live in fear, but I\u2019ve got to be really really cautious.\u201d\n\nIn nearby Salem, Trout\u2019s pulmonologist Martin Johnson said people with existing respiratory issues started showing up at his hospital or calling his office almost immediately after the smoke arrived, many struggling to breathe. Salem is in Marion county, which experienced eight days of pollution at hazardous levels during a short period, some of the worst conditions seen the West over the past two decades, according to AP\u2019s analysis.\n\nMost of Johnson\u2019s patients are expected to recover but he said some could have permanent loss of lung function. Then there are the \u201chidden\u201d victims who Johnson suspects died from heart attacks or other problems triggered by the poor air quality but whose cause of death will be chalked up to something else.\n\n\u201cMany won\u2019t show up at the hospital or they\u2019ll die at home or they\u2019ll show up at hospice for other reasons, such as pneumonia or other complications,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBased on prior studies of pollution-related deaths and the number of people exposed to recent fires, researchers at Stanford University estimated that as many as 3,000 people over 65 in California alone died prematurely after being exposed to smoke during a six-week period beginning Aug. 1. Hundreds more deaths could have occurred in Washington over several weeks of poor air caused by the fires, according to University of Washington researchers.\n\nThe findings for both states have not been published in peer-reviewed journals. No such estimate was available for Oregon.\n\nWildfires are a regular occurrence in Western states but they\u2019ve grown more intense and dangerous as a changing climate dries out forests thick with trees and underbrush from decades of fire suppression. What makes the smoke from these fires dangerous are particles too small for the naked eye to see that can be breathed in and cause respiratory problems.\n\nOn any given day, western fires can produce 10 times more particles than are produced by all other pollution sources including vehicle emissions and industrial facilities, said Shawn Urbanski, a U.S. Forest Service smoke scientist.\n\nFires across the West emitted more than a million tons of the particles in 2012, 2015 and 2017, and almost as much in 2018 \u2014 the year a blaze in Paradise, California killed 85 people and burned 14,000 houses, generating a thick plume that blanketed portions of Northern California for weeks. Figures for 2017 and 2018 are preliminary.\n\nAP Photo/Noah Berger A firefighter passes flames while battling the Glass Fire in a Calistoga, Calif., vineyard on Oct. 1, 2020.\n\nA confluence of meteorological events made the smoke especially bad this year: first, fierce winds up and down the coast whipped fires into a fury, followed in Oregon by a weather inversion that trapped smoke close to the ground and made it inescapable for days. Hundreds of miles to the south in San Francisco, smoke turned day into night, casting an eerie orange pall over a city where even before the pandemic facemasks had become common at times to protect against smoke.\n\nAP\u2019s analysis of smoke exposure was based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data compiled from hundreds of air quality monitoring stations. Census data was used to determine the numbers of people living in affected areas of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Montana.\n\nAt least 38 million people live in counties subjected to pollution considered unhealthy for the general population for five days, according to AP\u2019s analysis. That included more than 25 million people in California, 7.2 million in Washington, 3.5 million in Oregon, 1 million in Idaho and 299,000 people in Montana.\n\nThe state totals for the number of people exposed to unhealthy air on a given day were derived from counties where at least one monitoring site registered unhealthy air.\n\nScientists studying long-term health problems have found correlations between smoke exposure and decreased lung function, weakened immune systems and higher rates of flu. That includes studies from northwestern Montana communities blanketed with smoke for weeks in 2017.\n\n\u201cParticulate matter enters your lungs, it gets way down deep, it irrigates the lining and it possibly enters your bloodstream,\u201d said University of Montana professor Erin Landguth. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the effects.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus raises a compounding set of worries: An emerging body of research connects increased air pollution with greater rates of infection and severity of symptoms, said Gabriela Goldfarb, manager of environmental health for the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nClimate experts say residents of the West Coast and Northern Rockies should brace for more frequent major smoke events, as warming temperatures and drought fuel bigger, more intense fires.\n\nTheir message is that climate change isn\u2019t going to bring worse conditions: they are already here. The scale of this year\u2019s fires is pushing the envelope\u201d of wildfire severity modeled out to 2050, said Harvard university climate researcher Loretta Mickley\n\n\u201cThe bad years will increase. The smoke will increase,\u201d said Jeffrey Pierce an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable that we could be getting a 2020-type year every other year.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBrown reported from Billings, Montana.\n\n___\n\nOn Twitter follow Matthew Brown: @MatthewBrownAP and Camille Fassett: @camfassett.",

        "article": "Twice this week, Amy Coney Barrett refused to acknowledge the scientific reality that the climate is changing.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was \u201cnot a scientist\u201d and therefore did \u201cnot have firm views\u201d on the shifts in weather patterns, record-breaking temperatures and melting polar ice that even the most ardent defenders of the fossil fuel industry acknowledge. On Wednesday, she doubled down, saying that the very issue of climate change was \u201ca very contentious matter of public debate\u201d and \u201cpolitically controversial.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t, at least not for the vast majority of Americans or scientists going back nearly two centuries.\n\nAs far back as 1827, scientists understood that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels would prevent the sun\u2019s heat from escaping back into space. By the 1970s, in-house researchers at Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp. and other oil giants confirmed that such warming was taking place and warned executives about it. Instead of reducing emissions, the industry hired some of the same campaigners that tobacco companies employed to seed doubt over the link between cigarettes and cancer to work on redirecting the political debate over how to address emissions into an argument over whether to do so at all.\n\nSince then, carbon dioxide has surged past levels ever experienced in human history. The effects scientists long warned of \u2015 hotter temperatures, more extreme weather, rising seas \u2015 arrived, often sooner and with more intensity than models had predicted.\n\nJonathan Ernst-Pool/Getty Images Confused on climate science?\n\nCountries closer to the equator are already experiencing some of the worst of it. But the United States is badly suffering. Wildfires in California consumed an unprecedented 4 million acres in just the past few weeks. The hyperactive hurricane season in the Atlantic this year broke several records, inundating Gulf states amid a pandemic. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years in history occurred since 2001, and federal scientists on Wednesday declared last month the hottest September since recordkeeping began 141 years ago.\n\nEven Trump, who has long mocked climate science as a hoax, and the administration officials overseeing the rollback of rules to curb planet-heating gases, admit the climate is changing.\n\nIf confirmed, Barrett would be the fifth of nine Supreme Court justices nominated by a president who lost the popular vote. Yet her apparent views on climate science may be the most jarring example of how her lifetime appointment represents minority rule.\n\nSeventy-two percent of Americans recognize the climate is changing, and 58% understand humans are the primary cause, according to national survey data by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Gallup pegged the latter number even higher, last year finding that 66% of Americans \u201cbelieve global warming is caused by human activities.\u201d The Pew Research Center last year found that 67% of U.S. adults think the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change.\n\nSeventy percent of likely voters polled by the think tank Data for Progress late last month agreed with the 2007 Supreme Court decision that found carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases qualify as pollutants that the Environmental Protection Agency should regulate under the Clean Air Act. Most Republicans, 65%, agreed with the decision, which has forced the Trump administration to preserve some rules on planet-heating pollution.\n\nShould the Republican-controlled Senate confirm Barrett, that public understanding of reality could weigh on her rulings.\n\nNineteen of the 20 warmest years in history occurred since 2001, and federal scientists on Wednesday declared last month the hottest September since records began 141 years ago.\n\nA 2011 paper in the American Journal of Political Science concluded that \u201cthe influence of public opinion on Supreme Court decisions is real\u201d and \u201csubstantively important.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s landmark rulings to desegregate schools and legalize same-sex marriage \u201cwere inconceivable until enormous changes in the surrounding social and political context had first occurred,\u201d Harvard Law School professor Michael Klarman wrote in 2015.\n\nThe conservative-leaning bench already proved itself willing to strike down even modest regulations to curb greenhouse gases on technicalities. In 2016, the court ordered the Obama administration to temporarily halt implementation of a rule to limit emissions from power plants, handing a victory to Republican-led states that argued the regulation exceeded the federal government\u2019s legal mandate.\n\nBarrett\u2019s unstated beliefs could face an early test. Less than two weeks before her confirmation hearings began, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal by oil giants over lawsuits by cities seeking to hold the companies liable for climate damages. The firms, including BP and Royal Dutch Shell, want to move the suits from state to federal courts, where the industry expects more favorable rulings.\n\nBarrett\u2019s father, a Catholic deacon and former attorney, Mike Coney, said on his church\u2019s website that \u201cmost of my legal career was spent as an attorney with Shell.\u201d As the investigative newsletter The Daily Poster reported, Barrett included the Anglo-Dutch oil behemoth seven times in the recusal list that guides her work as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, which she submitted to the Senate in her questionnaire. The list works as part of the court\u2019s \u201cautomatic recusal system to help identify potential conflicts for the judges,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cRecusal itself is a legal issue,\u201d Barrett said during Tuesday\u2019s confirmation hearing. \u201cJustice Ginsburg, in explaining the way recusal works, said that it\u2019s always up to the individual justice, but it always involves consultation with the colleagues \u2015 with the other eight justices. So that\u2019s not a question that I could answer in the abstract.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2015 the big business lobby which so aggressively promoted climate denial that some members of Congress and environmentalists dubbed it the \u201cChamber of Carbon\u201d \u2015 filed an amicus brief backing the oil companies\u2019 appeal before the Supreme Court in April. The group swiftly endorsed Barrett\u2019s nomination last month and began lobbying lawmakers to confirm her to the bench.",

        "article": "Gerry Broome/Associated Press The Fayetteville Works plant where Chemours manufactures a chemical that has entered the Cape Fear River, a source of drinking water for much of the southeastern part of North Carolina.\n\nIn North Carolina\u2019s Cape Fear River basin, levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, have been recorded at 1,000 times the level considered safe for human consumption. Both federal data and anecdotal evidence strongly suggest that these manufactured chemicals are linked to abnormally high rates of thyroid cancer and some other rare cancers.\n\nPFAS have been at the forefront of an emotional public debate in the southeastern part of the state since 2016, when it was discovered that a plant owned by PFAS manufacturer Chemours in Fayetteville had contaminated the drinking water for 250,000 downstream residents. But as people plead for stronger government action, underfunded state agencies haven\u2019t been able to fully respond \u2015 even as North Carolina sits on a $2.5 billion budget surplus.\n\nThat\u2019s because the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature has financially kneecapped the agencies dealing with PFAS-related issues, leaving them unable to adequately test water, study health impacts, clean up the contamination and hold polluters accountable. Meanwhile, money that could save lives around the Cape Fear region now sits unspent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost criminal,\u201d said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the Clean Cape Fear advocacy group. \u201cThere seems to be an unwillingness at the state level to fully research PFAS exposures and we\u2019re left almost begging them to please pay attention and do something.\u201d\n\nInstead of appropriately funding the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the agency that officially handles environmental crises, the legislature created the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory, a program made up of state university researchers who study issues around PFAS contamination.\n\nWhile those on all sides agree that funding academic research is a useful step, critics say the collaboratory merely creates the appearance of serious action but has been deliberately designed to be ineffective.\n\nUniversity researchers don\u2019t have regulatory authority so they can\u2019t enforce environmental laws, order cleanups or take legal action against polluters. The DEQ and other state agencies also can\u2019t use information that the collaboratory gathers in a regulatory capacity because their data must be collected using an officially approved methodology and must remain in the state\u2019s \u201cchain of custody.\u201d\n\nState agencies are left unable to carry out basic responses to the PFAS crisis and protect the public, said Grady McCallie, policy director for the North Carolina Conservation Network. The state hasn\u2019t been adequately monitoring tap water, regularly checking residents\u2019 blood or mounting a sufficient legal challenge against polluters, he said.\n\n\u201c[The collaboratory is] generating excellent information but it\u2019s not information that you can regulate with, and that\u2019s by design,\u201d McCallie said, adding that the state has enough money to fully staff both the DEQ and the collaboratory. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or choice.\u201d\n\nThe debate is also political. Republicans in the state legislature installed the collaboratory\u2019s leadership, which gives the GOP more control over environmental regulation at a time when Democrats control the state\u2019s regulatory agencies. Critics contend that Republicans have executed a cynical plan to strip Democrats of their power to hold chemical companies and polluters accountable for PFAS contamination.\n\n\u201cPFAS is now a political issue, though it should be nonpartisan,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Harper Peterson, who in 2019 introduced a comprehensive PFAS bill that Republicans killed. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to study and not take the necessary action.\u201d\n\nGerry Broome/Associated Press Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has requested more funding for the state Department of Environmental Quality, but Republicans have repeatedly rejected those requests.\n\nAssault On The Regulatory System\n\nPFAS is a class of about 7,500 fluorinated compounds dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they don\u2019t break down and can\u2019t be destroyed. They make products water- and stain-resistant, and are used in everything from Teflon to Scotchgard to food packaging.\n\nThe now-ubiquitous compounds are increasingly linked to a range of cancers, liver disease, kidney disease and other serious illnesses, and are behind a growing number of public health crises around the country.\n\nThough the DEQ should take the lead on addressing contamination in North Carolina, the GOP-controlled legislature in 2010 began a six-year process of slashing the department\u2019s budget by nearly 40%. The cuts forced the elimination of about 400 positions. And while Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was elected in 2016, has requested more funding for the DEQ, Republicans have repeatedly rejected those requests.\n\nAt the same time, GOP budget cuts to the North Carolina Attorney General\u2019s Office, now run by Democrat Josh Stein, forced the elimination of 23 attorneys from its environmental division. (Cooper and Stein are both up for reelection this year.)\n\nThough some positions in the attorney general\u2019s office have since been restored, the cuts have directly impacted the state\u2019s ability to take on PFAS polluters, Stein said in an email.\n\n\u201cWhile I have great confidence in my attorneys and the hard work they do to protect our state\u2019s clean air and water, there\u2019s no doubt that our Environmental Division is underfunded and understaffed,\u201d Stein said. \u201cWe are simply not funded at a level that allows us to protect the state from these dangerous chemicals to the extent needed.\u201d\n\nThe state has been successful in its only legal battle over PFAS contamination. A consent order issued last year and updated in August requires Chemours to cut emissions, reduce discharges and begin cleanup.\n\nBut McCallie said \u201cthe fight is far from over\u201d as Chemours, which was spun off from chemical giant DuPont in 2015, is hardly the only company discharging PFAS in North Carolina. Multiple industrial polluters are thought to be responsible for contamination in the Haw River, and sewage sludge spread on agricultural land is also behind high PFAS levels in some waterways. Stein\u2019s office hired outside help to look at legal strategies for addressing contamination statewide, and on Oct. 13 it announced the first lawsuit stemming from that effort. The suit seeks damages from DuPont, which it alleges created and undercapitalized Chemours to avoid \u201cmassive liabilities.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Republican lawmakers have also proposed $73 million in additional cuts to the state Department of Health and Human Services, which is the agency that should execute epidemiological studies essential to an effective response.\n\nThe economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has further complicated the situation. The state may need to dip into some of its reserves to cover revenue shortfalls, and it\u2019s in the process of developing a new budget. The GOP is already floating the idea of more cuts to the DEQ.\n\nBy not fully funding these agencies, Republicans have amassed a budget surplus at the expense of North Carolinians\u2019 lives, said Democratic state Rep. Deb Butler.\n\n\u201cGOP leaders run around touting that there\u2019s a surplus, but it\u2019s not a surplus when you\u2019re not meeting people\u2019s needs,\u201d she said.\n\nWhere Are \u2018The Water Police\u2019?\n\nAs in many towns in North Carolina and across the nation that have discovered PFAS in their water, public health advocates in Pittsboro suspect the chemicals are behind a range of illnesses.\n\nOne family reports that their two children have lost the ability to regulate their body temperature, said Emily Sutton, the designated riverkeeper for the Haw River Assembly. Another child who moved to Pittsboro started getting migraines that stopped once they quit drinking the town\u2019s water. Other longtime residents are facing health problems that studies have previously linked to PFAS \u2014 gall bladder disease, thyroid disease and miscarriages.\n\nSutton said that recent Haw River sampling found PFAS counts over 1,000 parts per trillion. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s advisory limit for PFOA and PFOS \u2014 two types of PFAS \u2014 in drinking water is 70 ppt. Some states have set their own lower limits, though North Carolina is not one of them.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure what the health impacts are, but these are healthy people who move to the community and start having health problems,\u201d Sutton said. The contamination\u2019s source is unclear, but upstream industry, landfill leaching and sewage sludge applied to cropland are all suspects.\n\nDespite the clear concerns, the state is offering Pittsboro little help, Sutton said. A scientist with the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory has tested residents\u2019 blood, but the DEQ is focusing its limited resources downstream where Chemours is responsible for much of the \u201cstaggering\u201d contamination in the Cape Fear basin.\n\nCities across southeastern North Carolina face similar uncertainty, but the state isn\u2019t undertaking the type of wide-scale epidemiological study that\u2019s needed to understand the scope of the crisis and respond appropriately. The collaboratory is gathering some health data and working to understand more about how PFAS impact human health, but McCallie said those efforts represent \u201ca fraction of what we need to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for a lot more money to be spent on epidemiological research and studies on different health impacts,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the state isn\u2019t monitoring tap water. The DEQ and the collaboratory have conducted piecemeal testing of drinking water supplies and sewage plants throughout the state, and the DEQ is attempting to identify some PFAS polluters. But only a few local water districts are sampling water that comes out of the tap, said Donovan. The levels of PFAS found are consistently high. Though most other states aren\u2019t monitoring tap water either, those that are have also found unsafe levels of fluorinated compounds in multiple districts.\n\nThe data on PFAS in water supplies gathered by the collaboratory could be used to generally inform the state\u2019s decision-making. The DEQ can\u2019t use it to enforce discharge limits, water quality standards or permit conditions with reporting requirements, however, because the agency has a legal process it must follow in enforcing laws.\n\nThe DEQ could be considered \u201cthe water police,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThey have a system that they have to follow to be able to enforce the law, so it\u2019s almost like we have these citizen arrests that are meaningless until the actual state agency can get involved and do their due process,\u201d she explained.\n\nRegardless, environmentalists argue that the DEQ could do more without additional funds. It could regulate PFAS as a class instead of on an individual basis. Currently, each PFAS compound is treated separately even though they share similar traits. Regulating one group of chemicals is far more efficient than trying to regulate some 7,500 individual compounds.\n\nIt could also outright ban the discharge of PFAS into water or air, McCallie said.\n\n\u201cWhat that would do is force companies to find a different way of disposing of it, or they would need to change their production process so they\u2019re not generating waste with PFAS,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause of the DEQ and the state legislature\u2019s failure to act, North Carolinians whose drinking water is contaminated with PFAS must pay for filters that can cost thousands of dollars themselves.\n\n\u201cThat leaves all these communities vulnerable,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any funding and people are left holding the bill to provide their families with clean drinking water.\u201d",

        "article": "Christine Simmons/San Diego Zoo Global via AP This Sept. 1, 2020 photo provided by San Diego Zoo Global shows Kurt, a tiny horse who is actually a clone. Little Kurt looks like any other baby horse as he frolics playfully in his pen. But the 2-month-old, dun-colored colt was created by fusing cells taken from an endangered Przewalski's horse at the San Diego Zoo in 1980. The cells were infused with an egg from a domestic horse that gave birth to Kurt two months ago. The baby boy was named for Kurt Benirschke, a founder of the San Diego Zoo's Frozen Zoo, where thousands of cell cultures are stored. Scientists hope he'll help restore the Przewalski's population, which numbers only about 2,000.\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 Little Kurt looks like any other baby horse as he frolics playfully in his pen. He isn\u2019t afraid to kick or head-butt an intruder who gets in his way and, when he\u2019s hungry, dashes over to his mother for milk.\n\nBut 2-month-old Kurt differs from every other baby horse of his kind in one distinct way: He\u2019s a clone.\n\nThe rare, endangered Przewalski\u2019s horse was created from cells taken from a stallion that had sat frozen at the San Diego Zoo for 40 years before they were fused with an egg from a domestic horse.\n\nWith the egg\u2019s nucleus removed, ensuring Kurt would be basically all Przewalski\u2019s horse, they were implanted in the mare who would become his mom on Aug. 6.\n\nThe result, officials say, was the world\u2019s first cloned Przewalski\u2019s horse.\n\nThe zoo sees his birth as a milestone in efforts to restore the population of the horse also known as the Asiatic Wild Horse or Mongolian Wild Horse. The small, stocky animals (they stand only about 4 to 5 feet tall at the withers) are believed extinct in the wild and number only about 2,000 in zoos and wildlife habitats. Their limited gene pool puts them at a reproductive disadvantage.\n\n\u201cThis colt is expected to be one of the most genetically important individuals of his species,\u201d Bob Wiese, chief life sciences officer at San Diego Zoo Global, which operates the zoo, said in a statement. \u201cWe are hopeful that he will bring back genetic variation important for the future of the Przewalski\u2019s horse population.\u201d\n\nAlthough only 2 months old, Kurt\u2019s birth was made possible in 1980 when cells were taken from a 5-year-old stallion and put in deep freeze at San Diego\u2019s Frozen Zoo facility. His father died in 1998.\n\nKurt was named for Kurt Benirschke, who played a key role in founding the Frozen Zoo with its extensive research program and cell cultures.\n\n\u201cA central tenet of the Frozen Zoo, when it was established by Dr. Benirschke, was that it would be used for purposes not possible at the time,\u201d said Oliver Ryder, director of genetics at San Diego Zoo Global.\n\nThe zoo worked in collaboration with the California conservation group Revive & Restore and the Texas-based company ViaGen Equine in creating Kurt.\n\nHe was born at a veterinary facility in Texas where he\u2019ll continue to live with his mother for most likely another year.\n\nEventually he\u2019ll be integrated into the zoo\u2019s Przewalski\u2019s horse population, where it\u2019s hoped someday he\u2019ll become a father himself.\n\nPrzewalski\u2019s horses take their official name from Russian explorer Nikolai Przewalski, who found a skull and hide of one and shared it with a Russian museum.\n\nAt one time they ranged throughout Europe and Asia, according to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Biology Conservation Institute. Encroaching human population and livestock eventually pushed them out of Europe and east to parts of Asia like the Gobi Desert. Outside of zoos, they exist today only in reintroduction sites in Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan.\n\nAccording to the Smithsonian, they are the only true wild horses left in the world. The institute maintains wild horse herds in North America and Australia don\u2019t count because they are the ancestors of escaped domesticated horses.",

Kamala Harris of California, a committee member and Joe Biden\u2019s running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, asked Barrett if she believed in other scientifically proven facts before bringing up climate change.\n\n\u201cDo you accept that COVID-19 is infectious?\u201d Harris asked.\n\n\u201cYes, I do accept that COVID-19 is infectious,\u201d Barrett said with a chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s something of which I feel we can say, we take judicial notice of it. It\u2019s an obvious fact, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you accept that smoking causes cancer?\u201d Harris continued.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly where you\u2019re going with this,\u201d Barrett replied. \u201cYes, every package of cigarettes warns that smoking causes cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you believe climate change is happening and threatening the air we breathe and water we drink?\u201d asked Harris.\n\nThat\u2019s when Barrett balked.\n\n\u201cYou have asked me a series of questions that are completely uncontroversial, like whether COVID-19 is infectious, whether smoking causes cancer, and then trying to analogize that to elicit an opinion from me that is on a very contentious matter of public debate,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not do that.\u201d\n\nBarrett continued, \u201cI will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial, because that\u2019s inconsistent with the judicial role.\u201d\n\nClimate change itself is not a policy matter \u2015 how do deal with it is. Nor should it be viewed as controversial. As spelled out on NASA\u2019s climate change website for children, it is happening and the primary cause is greenhouse gas emissions from cars, power plants and other human-made sources.\n\nNASA scientists track the planet\u2019s surface warming, and many of the past 20 years have been the warmest on record. A group of 1,300 scientific experts from around the world has concluded a more than 95% probability exists that human activities over the past 50 years have contributed to this warming.\n\nHarris let Barrett\u2019s refusal to comment on climate change speak for itself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made your point clear that you believe it\u2019s a debatable point,\u201d she said.",

Demand for gas was forecast to keep growing over the next decade, particularly in Asia, though the fuel could decline as renewables come online at a faster rate. But the world\u2019s appetite for oil was projected to peak by 2030.\n\n\u201cThe era of global oil demand growth will come to an end in the next decade,\u201d Birol said. \u201cBut without a large shift in government policies, there is no sign of a rapid decline.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that grid operators remain \u201cthe weak link in the transformation of the power sector,\u201d with demand for new transmission lines to carry electricity from sun-soaked or windy locales to densely populated areas growing by 80% compared to the past decade.\n\nThe report also found that worldwide poverty levels increased in 2020, making electricity unaffordable for more than 100 million people who already had electricity connections. The IEA expected the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa without any electricity at all \u2015 a figure that already topped 580 million people, nearly twice the population of the United States \u2015 to grow this year, reversing years of progress.\n\nTo keep global temperatures from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages, the steady deployment of renewables will need to be coupled with the increased use of low-carbon hydrogen fuels and carbon capture technology. Advanced nuclear reactors could also play a key role, the report said.",

        "article": "SYDNEY \u2014 Half of the corals on Australia\u2019s iconic Great Barrier Reef have died since the 1990s, according to a troubling new study that analyzed just how devastating years of catastrophic mass bleaching have been for one of the most biodiverse structures on Earth.\n\nThe paper, published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found dramatic losses of corals large and small, of nearly every major species, from branching colonies of pale yellow staghorn to massive protrusions that look like underwater tables.\n\nThe loss of so many corals along nearly every section of the 1,600-mile reef is shocking. Larger corals can take years or decades to grow, and effectively act as both the parents and home for a new generation of coral polyps that replace them. The researchers analyzed the number of corals along sections of 30 reefs up and down the Great Barrier 20 years apart, in 1996 and in 2016, and found populations of elder, adolescent and baby corals had all fallen by more than 50% in just 20 years.\n\nDr. Andreas Dietzel, a researcher at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and the lead author of the paper, compared the loss of coral colonies across the reef system to an international conflict.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this in human populations,\u201d Dietzel told HuffPost. \u201cAfter a big war, you can see a massive dent in the number of middle-aged men.\u201d\n\nWith corals, he added, it\u2019s worse: \u201cThey\u2019ve declined pretty much across all sizes. We\u2019re losing a lot of the big ones, but we\u2019re also losing a lot of small ones.\u201d\n\nAndreas Dietzel/ARC Centre for Excellence The Great Barrier Reef suffered mass coral bleaching events in 2016, 2017 and 2020.\n\nAndreas Dietzel/ARC Centre for Excellence The Great Barrier Reef has lost half its corals in the past three decades.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is still recovering from a series of devastating, back-to-back mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 when hotter-than-usual seawater washed over the delicate structures, effectively cooking them. The environmental change can cause ruby- and topaz-colored corals to turn ghostly white as the algae that feeds them flees their skeletons. If temperatures return to normal, the algae may return and the corals can recover, but if it stays too hot for too long, the corals will die.\n\n\u201cAs a marine biologist, I know that a bleached coral is very unhealthy, but it can provide some very breathtaking colonies,\u201d Dietzel said, saying some reefs he\u2019s visited in recent years looked like ghost towns. \u201cTourists say, \u2018Whoa, this looks beautiful.\u2019 But as a scientist, you\u2019re well aware they\u2019re either starving or dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of these bleached colonies, once the external algae grow over the dead skeleton, that colony is gone,\u201d he added. \u201cIt may take hundreds of years to replace a colony of that size.\u201d\n\nNOAA Coral bleaching leaves the delicate structures sick and vulnerable.\n\nThe back-to-back events were declared a one-two punch to large swaths of the Great Barrier by scientists at the time, who likened the event to an underwater apocalypse while expressing hope that action on climate change could help the structures recover and grow.\n\nBut earlier this year, researchers said the reef was suffering from mass bleaching again, the third time in just five years. In February, average temperatures on the reef were the highest ever recorded since record-keeping began in 1900.\n\nDr. Terry Hughes, a professor at the ARC Centre and a co-author of the paper, has long said climate change remains the single greatest threat to the future of the Great Barrier as we know it.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is for the temperature to stop rising, and to even out at a level that\u2019s not too hot,\u201d he told HuffPost, expressing hope that the reef will survive, albeit as a different ecosystem. \u201cWe\u2019re on this journey, we have a ways to go, and the endpoint will be determined by greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nAndreas Dietzel/ARC Centre for Excellence Giant table corals and branching corals were dramatically impacted by three bouts of mass bleaching along the Great Barrier Reef. \"They are important because they provide the three-dimensionality, the nooks and crannies that fish depend on,\" Dr. Terry Hughes said.\n\nThe study is one of the first long-term analyses of the Great Barrier Reef and its coral density. Traditionally, scientists have flown over hundreds of miles of the structure via helicopter and monitored the \u201ccoral cover,\u201d or how much of the reef appeared either healthy or bleached from afar. This time, Dietzel and Hughes got in the water, which Hughes said allowed their team to see that the size of the many corals now resembles something out of \u201cHoney, I Shrunk the Kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe loss of big corals right across the board, in terms of every species, is important because they\u2019re the mature adults that make the next generation of juvenile corals \u2014 they\u2019re the breeders,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe capacity of the reef to bounce back is increasingly compromised.\u201d\n\nHughes added that the idea the reef is under threat doesn\u2019t convey just how urgently the world needs to address climate change if it hopes to save the Great Barrier Reef and other reef systems like it around the globe.\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018threat\u2019 is funny,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you threatened to punch me on the nose, it\u2019s something you might do. We\u2019ve been measuring the impacts on the Great Barrier Reef for 22 years \u2026 it\u2019s certainly not a future threat. It\u2019s been part of the ongoing saga for a long time.\u201d",

        "article": "Washington state officials said Monday they were again unsuccessful at live-tracking a \u201cmurder\u201d hornet while trying to find and destroy a nest of the giant insects.\n\nThe Washington State Department of Agriculture said an entomologist used dental floss to tie a tracking device on a female hornet, only to lose signs of her when she went into a forest.\n\nThe hornet was captured on Oct. 5 and kept alive with strawberry jam, which she seemed to enjoy, said Sven Spichiger, a department entomologist.\n\nScientists then tied a tracking device onto her body and released her two days later onto an apple tree. They lost track of her after she went through some blackberry bushes, though officials believe the tracker was still attached at the time of its last signal.\n\n\u201cThis one was a lot feistier,\u201d Spichiger said.\n\nA total of 18 hornets have been found in the state since they were first seen last year near the U.S.-Canadian border, the agriculture department said.\n\nOfficials earlier in the month reported trying to glue a radio tag to another live hornet so they could follow it back to its nest, but the glue did not dry fast enough. The radio tag fell off and the hornet ultimately could not fly.\n\nThe Asian giant hornet \u2014 the world\u2019s largest at 2 inches (5 centimeters) \u2014 can decimate entire hives of honeybees and deliver painful stings to humans. Farmers in the northwestern U.S. depend on those honey bees to pollinate many crops, including raspberries and blueberries.\n\nDespite their nickname, the hornets kill at most a few dozen people a year in Asia, and experts say it is probably far less. Hornets, wasps and bees typically found in the United States kill an average of 62 people a year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.\n\nThe real threat from the \u201dmurder\u201d hornets is their devastating attacks on honeybee hives, and the time of year when they attack those hives is nearing, Spichiger said.

        "article": "The northern Peru birding route winds inland from the country\u2019s arid Pacific coast, through lowland forests and scrubland dotted with cacti, over the Andes Mountains to the Utcubamba River valley. In a tiny patch of cloud forest, 7,000 feet up along the valley\u2019s eastern slopes, lives the elusive marvelous spatuletail, perhaps the most spectacular hummingbird in the world, and one of the rarest.\n\nWeighing as much as a pair of pennies and measuring 10 to 15 centimeters long, the male has a head crested in brilliant blue feathers, its throat a burst of iridescent turquoise. More than half the bird\u2019s length is devoted to two extravagant tail feathers \u2014 slender appendages that splay dramatically outward and terminate in flashy violet disks, or spatules, like decorative fans.\n\nConstantino Aucca, a longtime conservationist, has been guiding bird-watchers in Peru for more than 30 years. In the 1990s, he would often bring tourists to this remote area near the town of Pomacochas, the only place on Earth to catch a glimpse of the spatuletail hummingbird.\n\nwebguzs via Getty Images The marvelous spatuletail hummingbird is endemic to the Peruvian Andes.\n\nBut he could see that the birds\u2019 already limited habitat range (less than 3,400 square miles, by one estimate) was getting smaller. Many of the local people raised cattle and they would chop down or set fires to trees to make way for grazing, sometimes destroying 20 acres of forest for just one or two cows.\n\nFearing for the future of the endangered marvelous spatuletail, Aucca set out to convince the community to protect and revitalize their degraded mountain landscape. Now, 20 years later, the preservation scheme he created, the first of its kind in Peru, is a thriving example of how reforestation, improved agricultural practices, and a culture of conservation can protect habitat for wild animals while also benefiting the people who live among them.\n\n\u201cIt serves as a model of what successful conservation looks like,\u201d said Daniel Lebbin, vice president of threatened species at the American Bird Conservancy.\n\nWhen Constantino Aucca first proposed the idea of a nature reserve in the area, people laughed at him, asking why he wanted to protect land that wouldn\u2019t even grow grass. 'I came for one bird,' he told them.\n\nAutumn is migration season for birds in North America. Some, like the Canada warbler, have flown thousands of miles to winter in the towering alders of the Andean forests around Pomacochas. These trees weren\u2019t here when Aucca was leading birding trips a few decades ago. Now, standing 50 feet tall and bustling with avian life, they are a testament to the work of Aucca and the Association of Andean Ecosystems (ECOAN), the conservation nonprofit he co-founded \u2014 along with ABC and other organizations \u2014 to establish a protected area and rehabilitate the weakened landscape.\n\nWhen Aucca, who lives in the city of Cuzco, more than 900 miles from Pomacochas, first proposed the idea of a nature reserve in the area, in 2003, people there laughed at him, asking why he wanted to protect land that wouldn\u2019t even grow grass.\n\n\u201cI came for one bird,\u201d he told them.\n\nThe locals were skeptical. They didn\u2019t believe anyone would attempt to regrow the blighted forest just for one tiny bird, or stick around long enough to do so.\n\nwebguzs via Getty Images A spatuletail hummingbird in flight about to get nectar from a flower. More than half of a male's length is taken up by its dramatic tail feathers.\n\nAt the time, Aucca said, international nongovernmental organizations lamented the way communities were destroying wildlife habitats, yet they resisted engaging those communities in their conservation efforts, seeing that as social work, not conservation.\n\nAucca disagreed. He thought it was vital to work with people who lived in the area, to get them invested, and to ensure they benefited as well.\n\nProponents of community-based conservation argue efforts to protect biodiversity are more successful when their goals align with those of the local people, and when those people are actively involved.\n\n\u201cIt is a fundamental strategy for conservation to involve local people,\u201d said Mariana Montoya, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Peru. \u201cConservation should be done that way \u2014 not just working with or for communities, conservation must be done by communities.\u201d\n\nAucca asked the residents of Pomacochas what they wanted in exchange for letting him reserve a parcel of land for conservation, and they said trees that would provide shade for their cows.\n\nHe told them: \u201cThis will provide food, trees, money and happiness.\u201d\n\nIt took time to gain the locals\u2019 trust. To reforest the area, ECOAN set up a tree nursery nearby. At first, Aucca had to pay landowners to let him plant seedlings on their property. But local leaders, including a farmer named Santos Montenegro who was particularly adept at spotting spatuletails on his property, helped spread an understanding of why restoring and protecting the habitat was good not just for animals, but for the community \u2014 including improving pastureland and prohibiting development that could pollute watersheds.\n\nDaniel Lebbin, American Bird Conservancy The tiny Huembo reserve is perched in the Andean cloud forests of northern Peru, near the town of Pomacochas.\n\nEventually, people came around to volunteer their land for reforesting. Between 2005 and 2006, ECOAN planted 11,000 native trees for the marvelous spatuletail and other species.\n\n\u201cWe have to involve the community in the subject of conservation so that people stop habits that are bad for the environment, like burning the forests every year,\u201d Montenegro told HuffPost.\n\nEnlisting ABC as a partner and financial backer, in 2005 Aucca convinced the community and a private landowner to grant them an ecological easement \u2014 a form of legally recognized protection, and the first of its kind in Peru \u2014 on about 80 acres of land. It was there, years earlier, he saw the incredible sight of three male spatuletails dancing around a bush bursting with blue flowers. The community still owned the land but agreed to limit its use to conservation activities and allow ECOAN to establish the Huembo hummingbird reserve and a small lodge for visitors (with money from another organization). All tourism profits would be evenly distributed among community members. Aucca hired Montenegro and his family to manage the property.\n\nneil bowman via Getty Images A marvelous spatuletail perched on a twig at Huembo Lodge.\n\nFor a long time, the marvelous spatuletail was difficult to find. Now, birding sites herald Huembo as a \u201cparadise\u201d for the endangered birds, where visitors can catch a glimpse of them, along with a dozen other hummingbird species, simply by sitting for an hour by the park\u2019s bird feeders.\n\n(Tourism doesn\u2019t bring in as much money as they\u2019d like \u2014 especially since the start of the pandemic \u2014 so Montenegro and ECOAN\u2019s director of conservation and development, Adrian Torres, plan to start selling coffee Montenegro grows in a small shade plantation on the reserve. The packages will be emblazoned with an image of the marvelous spatuletail.)\n\nECOAN and the American Bird Conservancy are working to develop a comprehensive monitoring system to track the species\u2019 numbers and to see how the birds are taking to the new forest growth. Huembo is tiny as reserves go (even with the addition of 17 acres in 2013), and though it doesn\u2019t take much to provide for a bird the size of a pingpong ball with antennae, the reserve alone can\u2019t protect the entire population, said ABC\u2019s Lebbin.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important, he stressed, is that the culture of conservation has spread beyond the reserve\u2019s boundaries \u2014 exemplifying what Robert Horwich, founder of the nonprofit Community Conservation, called \u201cconservation contagion.\u201d\n\nThere are no other institutions doing this reforestation work. ECOAN keeps going, and the people are happy. Santos Montenegro\n\n\u201cA big part of the success is changing the community\u2019s relationship with the bird,\u201d Lebbin said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing widespread awareness and care. Inside and outside of Huembo, people are planting species they know the bird feeds on.\u201d\n\nConservation awareness has been spreading throughout Peru, Montoya said, with community initiatives to protect natural resources sprouting up over the last 20 years \u2014 many started by the communities themselves. Even very small projects can have important effects, creating networks of conservation, prompting new efforts in nearby communities, and acting as ecological \u201cstepping stones\u201d connecting disparate conservation areas.\n\n\u201cThis is important because national protected areas or even regional protected areas really can\u2019t conserve everything,\u201d she explained. Vitally, she added, community and privately owned reserves are managed with and by local residents, and benefit their lives and livelihoods.\n\nConstantino Aucca Constantino Aucca (left) with Santos Montenegro (third from right), other ECOAN staff, and donors from American Bird Conservancy at Huembo reserve in 2018.\n\nMontenegro said the people of Pomacochas are very happy with ECOAN\u2019s tree nursery because it has enabled them to create living fences around their properties (saving the cost of building fences) and practice a silvopasture program, which combines managed forest and pastureland. That results in healthier soil, shade for grazing livestock, fruit and \u2014 after a decade or two of growth \u2014 timber that community members can use or sell. Some people are now growing vegetables among the alders, which enrich the soil with nitrogen.\n\n\u201cThe people keep planting,\u201d Montenegro said. \u201cThere are no other institutions doing this reforestation work. ECOAN keeps going, and the people are happy.\u201d\n\nDue in part to seeing the successful reforestation in Pomacochas, people around the region have asked ECOAN to help them designate land for ecological protection and revitalize natural habitats. The organization has planted 600,000 trees and bushes around Huembo and close to 1 million in other communities in northern Peru.\n\nTorres \u2014 who sports a tattoo of the marvelous spatuletail on his right arm \u2014 is working with small community initiatives along the northern birding route to help them learn to manage their forests, set up feeders and run responsible ecotourism operations. He aims for the small stretch of road near Pomacochas to be known, one day, as the Hummingbird Route.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.",

        "article": "The second Monday in October, traditionally called Columbus Day, is now known in 14 states, the District of Columbia and more than 130 cities as Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\n\nThe name change is symbolic and important, emphasizing the need to recognize and honor the history and culture of Indigenous people \u2014 rather than celebrating the European explorer who brought colonialism, disease and violence to their communities.\n\nThe story of Indigenous people in America is one that echoes around the globe. \u201cFrom the Amazon to the Kalahari, from the jungles of India to the Congo rainforest, ... tribal peoples ... suffer racism, land theft, forced development and genocidal violence,\u201d reads the website of Survival International, an organization that fights for the rights of Indigenous people.\n\nNative peoples have strong cultural ties to their lands and proud traditions of protecting natural resources. But they largely lack legal control of those lands, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by major industries such as fossil fuels, mining, logging and agriculture. Even today, they are being killed defending their ancestral homes.\n\nThere are many stories of the strength and survival of Indigenous people that rarely get told. This series of photos, submitted to Survival International for its \u201cWe, The People\u201d 2021 calendar, celebrates the resilience and pride of tribal people around the world as they fight to preserve their lives and their heritage.\n\nAbove: Brazil, 2019 \u2015 The Wauja are one of more than 300 distinct Indigenous peoples in Brazil.\n\nPablo Albarenga\n\nEcuador, 2020 \u2015 Veronica, an Achuar midwife, in her garden, where she grows medicinal plants to treat her patients. The Achuar people have lived in the Amazon Basin for thousands of years, their lands straddling the border between Ecuador and Peru, but today they face threats from climate change and the timber and oil companies. Together with her people, Veronica is fighting against those who exploit and destroy the Amazon rainforest.\n\nHannah Reyes Morales\n\nBayan-\u00d6lgii Province, Mongolia, 2018 \u2015 Zamanbol, 14, with her eagle hunting partner. Zamanbol is a Kazakh nomad who lives in the Altai region of Mongolia. She lives in town during the week to attend school, but on the weekends returns to her family\u2019s ger, or yurt. She is one of a number of young nomads who are embracing the traditional customs of their people, which stretch back centuries, in a bid to hold onto their identities and their connection to nature.\n\nUbiratan Surui\n\nWest-Central Brazil, 2017 \u2015 Children from the Paiter-Suru\u00ed, an Indigenous group of around 1,400 people who live in the Brazilian Amazon on the border between the states of Rond\u00f4nia and Mato Grosso. In 2012, they became the first tribe in the world to implement a carbon credit scheme \u2015 preserving the rainforest and selling credits to companies keen to offset their own climate footprints. But the discovery of gold and diamonds on the land fueled deforestation and the scheme was formally suspended in 2018. Members of the tribe still work to protect their land. Where Indigenous people steward their own land, there is half as much deforestation and high levels of biodiversity, research shows.\n\nKiliii Yuyan\n\nChukchi Sea, Alaska, U.S., 2018 \u2015 Knowledge of the sea ice is paramount to the survival of the In\u0303upiat people, who have hunted whales in sealskin boats above the Arctic Circle for millennia. In recent years, melting ice has made hunting and fishing more difficult and traveling from one village to another more dangerous. Indigenous peoples are least responsible for climate change, yet they pay the greatest price.\n\nVanessa Patax\u00f3\n\nSerra do Padeiro, Brazil, 2018 \u2015 Tupinamba\u0301 dancers. Indigenous communities around the world legally own only 10% of their lands. In Brazil, as in other parts of South America, industrial development drives Indigenous people such as the Tupinamba\u0301 from their homes, threatens their lives and livelihoods, and fractures their cultural heritage, which is closely tied to the land.\n\nDiana Mar\u00eda Navas\n\nColombia, 2020 \u2015 A leader of the Yagua community, whose land lies between Colombia and Peru. The rose-colored seeds of the achiote tree produce a pigment known as annatto.

        "article": "In the last decade, the humble coconut has experienced a tremendous boom in the Western world. It has gone from being an exotic tropical fruit, limited to desserts and the occasional pina colada, to an important pantry staple in its many forms \u2015 coconut oil, water, milk, cream, sugar, flour, flakes, chips and more.\n\nThe growing wellness industry has encouraged consumers to fold more coconut products into their lives. Coconut oil, for instance, has been touted for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and even fat-burning properties.\n\nBut there\u2019s another side to the demand for more coconut: It poses a threat to the environment and fails to produce living wages for farmers.\n\nWhile environmentalists encourage people to eat locally, sustainably and with a minimal carbon footprint, there is nothing local \u2015 or usually even continental \u2015 about the consumption of coconut in the United States and Europe, the largest importers of coconut products.\n\nMagone via Getty Images\n\nCoconut is native to Southeast Asia. While it grows in tropical countries around the world, nearly three-quarters of the world\u2019s supply still comes from the Philippines, Indonesia and India. According to a report released by Allied Market Research, the global coconut products industry was pegged at $12.75 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $31.1 billion by 2026.\n\nThe demand for coconuts in developed countries is putting a strain on their natural sustainable production by farmers in the developing world. Here\u2019s what has gone wrong.\n\nCoconut production utilizes harmful chemical fertilizers.\n\nTo increase their farm\u2019s profitability, many coconut farmers engage in \u201cmonocropping\u201d \u2015 growing just the one crop on the same land, year after year. The problem is, this practice eventually depletes nutrients from the soil, which then forces farmers to use chemical fertilizers, which are harmful to the environment.\n\nhelovi via Getty Images A coconut farmer works on his farm in Ubud, Indonesia.\n\nFueled by the newfound enthusiasm for coconut products in the West, major coconut producers have turned over massive acreage to this monoculture, leading to chemically intensive farming and ruining the biodiversity of land on which the coconut palms are planted.\n\n\u201cWe end up creating a monocrop plantation that will wipe out all other crops,\u201d said Tomy Mathew, founder of Fair Trade Alliance Kerala and an Indian fair trade and organic certified company that exports coconut products to the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMathew noted that large plantations in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, for example, are located in already water-starved regions whose water supplies are now being depleted \u201cat an alarming rate to irrigate these farms.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs it happened with cocoa, as with vanilla, that sort of resource-intensive production is not sustainable in the long run,\u201d Mathew said. Farmers working vanilla and cocoa plantations in the Indian state of Kerala saw tremendous loss of income when the prices for those commodities crashed. Afterward, he said, many of those farmers adopted a more sustainable multi-crop approach, circulating a variety of crops on their lands and distributing the risk that comes with planting just one.\n\n\u201cI believe that the growth of \u2018food trends\u2019 in the West/Global North puts an unfair and difficult burden on the poorer farmers in the Global South,\u201d said Simrit Malhi, a permaculture farmer at her family-owned Roundstone Farms. \u201cWe must remember that trees like coconut or avocado take a minimum of three to five years to mature and start producing fruit. Often by the time the fruits are ready, the trend has already passed, forcing poorer farmers to farm chemically to get faster results.\u201d\n\nShe pointed, as an example, to the environmental costs of chemically grown avocados in Mexico, planted to feed the avocado boom in the U.S.\n\nAs coconut trees age, their yield declines \u2015 and so does farmers\u2019 income.\n\nCoconut trees have a productive life of 30 to 40 years. As they age, they produce fewer and fewer coconuts. With many of their trees long past peak productivity, the coconut farming industry in Asia has been plagued with low yields for years. Harvests have declined since global production of coconut peaked in 2013.\n\nDespite Western demand, the Asia-Pacific region experienced an overall increase in production of only 1.3% per year from 2000 to 2015, while the Philippines has actually seen a decline in production in recent years. For many farmers, growing coconuts no longer fetches a sustainable income.\n\nxuanhuongho via Getty Images Workers process coconut fruit to make candy and oil in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam.\n\nThere are other challenges as well. \u201cMost planters are shying away from coconut production as a result of exorbitant wages being demanded to climb coconut trees and de-husk nuts,\u201d said Mathew Jose, founder of the company Farm Origin. He said market conditions in Kerala, the highest coconut-producing state in India, are one of the big reasons that production is on the decline. \u201cFarmers in that region are choosing instead to either commercialize their land or grow exotic fruit trees (rambutan, mangosteen) to increase revenue,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the surge in global consumption, farmers see low returns.\n\nThe ultimate profits from coconut products aren\u2019t trickling all the way down to the farmers.\n\nThe conglomerates whose products crowd supermarket shelves source coconuts from large-scale monocropping plantations that are corporatized and mechanized to ensure consistent supply. This leaves no significant space for the small, marginalized farmers struggling just to break even with their cost of production. They miss out on the benefits of this surging trade.\n\nTomy Mathew explained that aggregators and middlemen in the coconut trade drive fluctuations in the market price of coconut, which eventually affects farmers\u2019 livelihoods. \u201cWhen you average out [the market price fluctuation] against two to three harvest periods, the farmers are not being compensated,\u201d he said.\n\nJose noted that despite the increased demand for coconut products, \u201cplanters aren\u2019t seeing a corresponding increase in prices for raw coconuts. Most of the price increase happens after there is some value add in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nIn other words, as the commodity is sold from farmers to wholesalers to manufacturing and processing units, as it\u2019s packaged, exported and retailed, those other parts of the supply chain siphon off their profits. Virtually nothing of the final price of the packaged product is really reaching the primary producer.\n\ngustavo ramirez via Getty Images A Peruvian farmer holds fresh coconut on her farm.\n\n\u201cIf you work back that money of a $20 coconut oil, you will come back to a coconut being sold for [14 cents]. Unless it\u2019s a supply chain that promises a fair price to the primary producer, I would look at this product with a huge question mark,\u201d Mathew said.\n\nWhat consumers can do to encourage a fair supply chain.\n\nIn the U.S., consumer attention to coconut products remains focused on health issues and has yet to consider the ethical sourcing of these products. So what\u2019s the answer?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important to ask questions about sustainable supply chains,\u201d said Mathew, stressing the need for people to hold accountable the brands they patronize. In particular, he suggested looking for brands that try to ensure fair prices for coconut farmers and encourage multi-crop farming.\n\nBut the trade in commodities like coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar, spices and coconut has historically been dictated by international consumption patterns and driven by colonization. The repercussions of this trade must necessarily be confronted and tackled.\n\nWhile small niche companies are striving to build a more equitable, sustainable system, a majority of our food supply comes through massive corporate-run chains. Ultimately, a consumer-led movement will need to push for change and seek accountability from those corporations.",

But I believe that the nations of the world, ordinary people worldwide, are beginning to realize that greed does not actually lead to joy.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the lack of international collaboration at many climate change conferences he has attended, Attenborough added, \u201cThere should be no dominant nation on this planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that there\u2019s a time when we can begin to realize that the time for squabbling, the time for saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get the best bargain for my nation,\u2019 is over,\u201d the broadcaster said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to realize that we\u2019re living on the same planet, and some of us have been very lucky, and some of us have taken rather a bigger share of the glories and wealth of this planet than we deserve.

As soon as the space debris crosses over, it breaks down into what scientists call a \"meteor,\" which then vaporizes and \u2014 as a result of friction \u2014 appears as a bright streak of light in the sky.\n\n\"Because of their appearance, these streaks of light some people call meteors 'shooting stars,'\" NASA explains in a blog post. \"But scientists know that meteors are not stars at all \u2014 they are just bits of rock!\"\n\nOther meteor showers this year include the Leonids and Geminds in November and December, respectively.\n\nOrionid meteors\n\nOrionid meteors are small chunks of rock that break off Halley's Comet. These particular meteors are named after their point of origin \u2014 the constellation Orion.\n\nAs Halley makes its way into the inner solar system, it \"sheds\" debris and dust particles that eventually form into meteors, NASA explains.\n\n\"Halley treats us to a meteor shower twice a year as our planet passes by the debris cloud,\" NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke said in a 2015 NASA blog post. \"In May we have the Eta Aquariids, and in October the Orionids.\"\n\nAccording to NASA, Orionid meteors are known for their \"brightness and speed.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' James Rogers and Jennifer Earl contributed to this story.",

        "article": "At least seven people have been charged in an \"elaborate\" flying squirrel trafficking scheme in which poachers in Florida caught thousands of the rodents before selling them to buyers in Asia, officials said on Monday.\n\nPoachers are accused of illegally catching more than 3,500 flying squirrels, a protected species in Florida, over a three-year period, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\nThey allegedly set up to 10,000 traps in trees around the rural area of Marion County, Fla., located about 80 miles northwest of Orlando, before the rodents were sold to a wildlife dealer in Bushnell -- who resold them as captive-bred pets -- not wildlife.\n\nUK WOMAN ATTACKED BY DEER IN PARK CLAIMS SHE WAS NOT FEEDING DEER, CRITICIZES PARK RANGER'S RESPONSE\n\n\"Investigators learned buyers from South Korea would travel to the United States and purchase the flying squirrels from the wildlife dealer in Bushnell. The animals were then driven in rental cars to Chicago, where the source of the animals was further concealed, and the animals were exported to Asia by an unwitting international wildlife exporter,\" according to the FWC.\n\nThe dealer at the center of the operation was said to be Rodney Knox, 66, who netted as much as $213,800, the FWC said. He was a subject of a recent National Geographic report on the alleged scheme. The agency estimated the retail value of the captured animals at more than $1 million.\n\nThe FWC originally received a complaint from a \"concerned citizen\" back in January 2019 about individuals illegally trapping the rodents in the state. Over the next 19 months, investigators said they pieced together the scheme in which flying squirrels were illegally captured in multiple counties throughout Central Florida.\n\nRARE SEA TURTLE DISCOVERED ON SOUTH CAROLINA BEACH IN 'ELUSIVE' FIND\n\nAs the operation grew, couriers from the state of Georgia would take over the transports, officials said. Turtles and alligators were also allegedly smuggled in a similar fashion.\n\n\u201cWildlife conservation laws protect Florida\u2019s precious natural resources from abuse. The concerned citizen who initially reported this activity started an investigation that uncovered a major smuggling operation. These poachers could have severely damaged Florida\u2019s wildlife populations,\u201d said FWC Investigation section leader Maj. Grant Burton.\n\nKnox was charged with money laundering, grand theft, racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, scheme to defraud, and dealing in stolen property, according to the agency. At least six others face similar charges.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn some places, including South Korea, flying squirrels -- small rodents that glide between trees -- have found demand as pets.",

Red stars, which are significantly smaller than the sun, are also cooler and could allow for liquid water to exist on their orbiting planets, researchers note.\n\n\"Planets between about the radius of TOI-1266 b and c are quite rare, likely because of the effect of strong irradiation from the star, which can erode their atmospheres,\" the study's lead author, Brice-Olivier Demory, said in a statement.\n\n'ONE IN A MILLION' SUPER-EARTH DISCOVERED IN DEEP SPACE\n\nTOI-1266 b is considered a \"sub-Neptune\" due to it being two and a half times the size of Earth's diameter and TOI-1266 c is one-and-a-half times the size of Earth, putting it in the \"Super-Earth\" category.\n\nBoth TOI-1266 b and c have similar temperatures and though they are vastly different in size, are believed to have similar density, likely comprised of rocky and metallic components. They may also contain water, the researchers suggested.\n\nStudy co-author Yilen G\u00f3mez Maqueo Chew added that studying \"these two different types of planets in the same system is a great opportunity to better understand how these different sized planets come to be.\"\n\nThe researchers used the Mexico-based SAINT-EX telescope to make their discovery.\n\nNEARBY 'SUPER-EARTH' MAY BE HABITABLE, NASA SUGGESTS\n\nIn August 2019, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite discovered a super-Earth exoplanet located 31 light-years from Earth that may be \"habitable.\"\n\nEarlier this month, researchers identified 24 potentially \"superhabitable\" planets that may have conditions more suited to host life than Earth.\n\nSCIENTISTS SPOT PROMISING SUPER-EARTH PLANETS JUST 11 LIGHT-YEARS AWAY\n\nMore than 4,500 exoplanets have been discovered by NASA in total, approximately 50 of which were believed to potentially be habitable as of September 2018.

But for Extreme-E, launched by the same team behind Formula E, the environment considerations have been central since inception.\n\nElectric SUVs will compete off-road in five races across a nine-month calendar, which has been specially designed to negate much of the need for air freight of the cars and teams - instead organisers are currently reconditioning the former Royal Mail ship the St Helena to become a 'floating paddock'.\n\nExtreme E Odyssey 21 SUV has been tested by several drivers in France\n\nToday's announcement confirms that the St Helena will also become a floating laboratory.\n\nExtreme E are inviting scientists to join them and conduct research during voyages between race locations, with the work focusing on gaining a better understanding of climate change and suggesting opportunities to lessen impacts.\n\nDr Lucy Woodall, a senior research fellow at the University of Oxford and a member of Extreme E's science committee, said: \"This is going to be an opportunity for a broad range of scientists and we are really hoping to target those that are currently unrepresented on ships across the globe.\"\n\n\"When we bid as scientists to go on ships, there's a huge amount of competition, so we're looking at people who are over the age of 18 and with a minimum experience in a graduate programme.\n\n\"They've got the basic knowledge, maybe done stuff in coastal waters. And now is their opportunity to flourish in the high seas.\"\n\n\"Extreme E really appealed to me because of its environmental focus,\" Hamilton said. \"Every single one of us has the power to make a difference\"\n\nThe circulation and warming of our oceans is not just important for marine life, but also the wider climate of our planet and Dr Woodall says this presents an opportunity for a wide range of research that will continue with each yearly series.\n\n\"We think [research] is likely to be from climate change consequences and maybe looking at investigating strategies for mitigating those in the future. So this could be anything from the atmosphere or down to looking at how a large marine mammals operate in the ocean.\"\n\nThe series hopes to be net zero carbon itself by the end of its first season and is being backed by Lewis Hamilton, who has been increasingly vocal on issues around climate change and the environment.\n\nThe Formula 1 world champion is heading up the X44 team, which will compete in the series. The five race locations, including Greenland, Brazil and Senegal have all been chosen because they are areas considered to be at the frontline of climate change.\n\nBut the series is being careful not to make anything worse: \"There are environmental impact assessments, which independent auditors are looking at to make sure that there is minimal damage,\" added Woodall.\n\n\"In all of the locations there is going to be science legacy projects. Extreme-E is giving the publicity to the challenges of climate change: what do we need to do where are our behaviour changes?\"",

        "article": "Biodiversity: Why the nature crisis matters, in five graphics By Helen Briggs\n\nBBC Environment correspondent Published duration 30 September\n\nimage copyright Getty Images\n\nHuman activities are destroying the natural world, leading to the extinction of animal and plant species at an alarming rate. Now, world leaders are promising action to tackle the problem. But will it be enough?\n\nWhat is biodiversity and why does it matter?\n\nBiodiversity is the variety of all living things on Earth, and how they fit together in the web of life, bringing oxygen, water, food and countless other benefits.\n\nRecent reports and studies have produced alarming news about the state of nature.\n\nLast year, an intergovernmental panel of scientists said one million animal and plant species were now threatened with extinction.\n\nAre we living in an age of extinction?\n\nScientists have warned that we are entering the sixth mass extinction, with whatever we do now likely to define the future of humanity. The other five mass extinctions include the asteroid strike that killed off the dinosaurs and many species in the sea.\n\n\"We have no time to wait. Biodiversity loss, nature loss, it is at an unprecedented level in the history of mankind,\" says Elizabeth Mrema, the executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n\n\"We're the most dangerous species in global history.\"\n\nimage copyright Getty Images image caption The destruction of forests is altering ecosystems\n\nHumans are pushing other species to extinction through hunting, over-fishing and cutting down forests and grasslands.\n\nWe are almost entirely responsible for extinctions of mammals in past decades, according to one recent study.\n\nAnd predictions suggest a further 550 mammal species will be lost this century, if we continue along our current path.\n\nOne of the biggest problems for the species we share the planet with, is the rate at which we're transforming the natural landscape, through building roads and cities, and taking up more land to grow food.\n\nimage copyright Getty Images\n\nOff land, we are putting plastic into the oceans and depleting fish stocks.\n\nAssessments suggest 75% of land and 66% of the oceans has been degraded by human activity.\n\nHow do we get off the path to destruction?\n\nMoving off our current devastating trajectory will require some big changes.\n\nAt the United Nations Summit on Biodiversity in New York on 30 September, world leaders are expected to declare their countries' commitments to nature, and possibly a new way of doing things.\n\n\"They are not going to say: 'We will continue a path of destruction.' They are going to say: 'We will get on a path of sustainability',\" says Inger Andersen, the head of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nWhat is the plan for the future?\n\nCountries are being urged to put their names to an agreement which would be to biodiversity what the Paris climate accord is to climate change.\n\nThis comes under the remit of the Convention on Biological Diversity, an international treaty agreed to at the UN Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992.\n\nThe convention has three goals: the conservation of biological diversity; the sustainable use of nature; and the sharing of benefits arising from genetic science.\n\nCountries had until this year to reach the targets set a decade ago, which range from stopping extinction to cutting pollution and preserving forests. Despite some progress, none of the targets were achieved.\n\nWorld leaders are now being asked to sign up to a pledge to protect 30% of the world by 2030 through a ten-point plan that puts wildlife and the climate at the heart of recovery plans from the pandemic.\n\nThey have to promise to address the likes of climate change, deforestation, ecosystem degradation and pollution\n\nScientists say a huge amount is at stake; but it is still possible to reverse the decline in nature, if words and promises are acted upon.",

        "article": "A class action lawsuit has been filed against the mining company Anglo American over its alleged failure to prevent widespread toxic lead pollution in the Zambian town of Kabwe. The town hosted one of the world\u2019s biggest lead mines for many decades and scientists have reported \u201calarming\u201d levels of lead in people\u2019s blood.\n\n\u201cThe public environmental health disaster left behind by Anglo means there are more than 100,000 children and women of childbearing age in Kabwe who are likely to have suffered lead poisoning as a result of pollution caused by Anglo,\u201d according to the filed legal documents.\n\nThe lawyers argue that Anglo American\u2019s South African subsidiary is liable as it was responsible for the mine from 1925 to 1974 and that this was when the majority of the pollution was caused. Anglo had \u201ca duty of care to protect existing and future generations of residents of Kabwe\u201d, according to the legal documents.\n\nLead has long been known to be highly poisonous and there is \u201cno level of lead exposure that is known to be without harmful effects\u201d, according to the World Health Organization. A scientific study of 1,190 people in Kabwe published in 2019 called exposure levels there \u201calarming\u201d. It concluded: \u201cThis is the first study that has revealed the true extent of lead exposure in the whole Kabwe town, which poses a serious public hazard and should be given urgent attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildhood lead poisoning has devastating effects on neurological development and causes overt clinical signs including convulsions and coma,\u201d said the scientists. They found average blood lead levels were above that classed as high by US authorities in all but one of 13 districts in the town. In the most affected district, the average level was nine times above the US threshold.\n\nThe lead pollution is in the soil and dust that children play in, and two-year olds had the highest blood levels. Some young children had levels more than 20 times higher than the US threshold, which can cause severe brain damage or death according to the WHO.\n\nThe case is being brought by 13 representative plaintiffs. Some are children with very high blood lead levels and others are women, as lead pollution poses great risks to foetuses during pregnancy.\n\nThe class action alleges that Anglo America is liable for substantial emissions of lead into the local environment due to deficiencies in the operation of the mine and for failing to ensure the clean-up of contaminated land. The mine was transferred to a Zambian state-owned company in 1974 and closed in 1994.\n\nAnglo American\u2019s human rights policy states: \u201cWhere we have caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts we will contribute to their remediation as appropriate.\u201d\n\nRichard Meeran, at Leigh Day, a UK-based legal firm acting for the plaintiffs, said operating a large mine close to communities was a clear risk: \u201cUnfortunately, it appears that Anglo failed to ensure that sufficient measures were in place.\u201d\n\nZanele Mbuyisa, at law firm Mbuyisa Moleele in Johannesburg, which is also acting for the plaintiffs, said a 1970s study showed high blood lead levels: \u201cThe very same lead poisoning that was happening at that time is continuing happening now.\u201d\n\nAnother scientific study, published in 2018, found that Kabwe Town \u201cbelongs to the most contaminated districts in Africa\u201d and that \u201cthe development of a program of health care \u2026 is of utmost importance\u201d. The legal action is seeking the provision of a screening program, treatment, a clean-up of the pollution and compensation for those poisoned.\n\n\u201c[Anglo American] need to do something about it because they have destroyed our bodies and the lives of our children, as well as their brains,\u201d said the parent of one of the anonymous child plaintiffs, in a video recorded by the law firms.\n\nThe law firms have filed expert evidence from clinical toxicologists and mining and environmental specialists. The case is being funded by Augusta Ventures, the UK\u2019s largest litigation fund.\n\n\u201cAnglo American reports that a case has been filed in South Africa in relation to alleged lead poisoning in Zambia,\u201d said a company spokesperson. \u201cNo such claim has yet been served on Anglo American. Once the claim is received, the company will review the claims made by the firm and will take all necessary steps to vigorously defend its position.\u201d Leigh Day said the company had been served.\n\n\u201cBy way of context, Anglo American was one of a number of investors in the company that owned the Kabwe mine until the early 1970s,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAnglo American was, however, at all times, far from being a majority owner.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian reported from Kabwe in 2017 and found people collecting scrap lead in the giant waste heaps, where lead levels in the soil are extremely high. One young woman, Debola Kunda, was being helped by her four-year-old son. She was concerned about the health of her children, but said: \u201cHow will we eat if we stay at home?\u201d",

Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nAn application is set to be made to the minister within weeks, but conservationists and local people are mounting a campaign to save the peninsula.\n\nBuglife is to petition Natural England, the government\u2019s conservation watchdog, to make the peninsula a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) to protect its rare wildlife, which includes the distinguished jumping spider, a minuscule, critically endangered arachnid only found in one other location in Britain.\n\n\u201cThis site meets all the criteria to be an SSSI,\u201d said Paul Hetherington of Buglife. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic, massive open space right on the doorstep of a huge population in London. The \u2018nationally significant infrastructure\u2019 designation was brought in for motorways and HS2. How does building a theme park constitute national infrastructure?\u201d\n\nThe peninsula was once home to Britain\u2019s first cement works and later used for landfill but the \u201cbrownfield\u201d site has become \u201copen mosaic habitat\u201d \u2013 a mixture of scrub, orchid-rich grassland and hot microclimates created by old industry \u2013 one of the country\u2019s rarest wildlife havens.\n\nSpecial invertebrates include the brown-banded carder bee and the sea aster mining bee. There are also endangered water voles and more breeding birds (82 species) than at the better known Rainham Marshes nature reserve, including the endangered nightingale and marsh harrier.

Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nThe riverside area \u2013 where the London Resort proposes a ferry terminal bringing tourists from Essex \u2013 is a marine conservation zone, designated to protect the tentacled lagoon worm, less than 5mm long, which is a nationally scarce marine animal and protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.\n\nThe RSPB has called the site \u201can outstanding mosaic of grasslands, wetlands, scrub, inter-tidal habitats and brownfield features \u2026 in urgent need of designating as a SSSI\u201d.\n\nUnder the London Resort\u2019s plans, the 465-hectare site will be refashioned into attractions including the Studios, \u201ca gritty modern-day warehouse district that practically roars with the exhilarating thrills of big, blockbuster features\u201d, an \u201cenchanted\u201d woodland realm, ruins of a \u201cmysterious long-lost Mesoamerican civilisation\u201d and the Starport, \u201ca bustling 23rd-century landing zone\u201d.\n\nBut some local people would prefer to save it for its peaceful green space and real-life wildlife.\n\n\u201cThis has been Kent\u2019s best-kept secret,\u201d said Donna Zimmer, a local campaigner who regularly visits the peninsula to look for birds. \u201cYou never know what you are going to see. This marshland habitat is rare and the marshes do a great job stopping us from flooding. It\u2019s just bizarre that we want to develop them. Once it\u2019s gone we\u2019re never going to get this space back.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kim Smith: \u2018At the moment the nature can freely go between the areas but it won\u2019t if there\u2019s a great big resort in the middle.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nZimmer was also critical of project partners, including BBC Studios, which will enable the resort to use its programmes and characters. \u201cHow can the BBC be part of this?\u201d she said. \u201cWe are in a climate emergency, what happens next is up to everyone of us. Sir David Attenborough suggests that if we put nature at the heart of all our decisions we would make a big difference. The BBC should take this advice and withdraw its interest from the London Resort.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely devastated by the London Resort proposal,\u201d said Kim Smith, a local resident who walks around the peninsula every day. \u201cThis is the most wonderful place, like something out of Dickens, and it benefits our physical and mental health.\n\n\u201cAt the moment the nature can freely go between the areas but it won\u2019t if there\u2019s a great big resort in the middle. You wonder how nature can survive.\u201d\n\nThe London Resort said it would deliver a \u201cnet gain in biodiversity\u201d by enhancing land beyond the site and retaining two undeveloped areas of marshland and the local wildlife site at Botany Marsh.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The London resort proposals. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nA spokesperson for the London Resort said they had been surveying the site since 2012, understood the presence of rare species and proposed to translocate some \u201clost habitat\u201d, recreate open mosaic habitat elsewhere, and was exploring the possibility of creating a new salt marsh by the Thames.\n\n\u201cThe area has been largely left, unmanaged for decades and if it continues to be unmanaged, it will eventually turn to scrub and the precious habitats will be lost,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cWe are therefore proposing a series of habitat enhancements and management interventions to ensure that these habitats can continue to support the rich bird, invertebrate, reptile and small mammal species that are currently using the site.\u201d\n\nA recent consultation by the developers found 73% of respondents supported its approach to the environment, which includes new footpath routes, boardwalks in the marshes, \u201cwildlife zones\u201d without public access and new bird hides so people can enjoy the wildlife without disturbing it.\n\nBBC Studios had no comment to make on criticisms of its involvement and said its agreement with the London Resort was a preliminary one pending the outcome of public consultations.",

        "article": "The health costs of air pollution from roads are higher in London than any other city in Europe, a study has found.\n\nTwo other urban areas in the UK, Manchester and the West Midlands, have the 15th and 19th highest costs respectively among the 432 European cities analysed.\n\nThe research puts a figure on the social costs of car emissions at local level at an unprecedented number of sites across 30 countries \u2013 the EU27 plus the UK, Norway and Switzerland.\n\nThe costs measure the overall erosion of public welfare, defined as living a long and healthy life in a clean environment. The research quantifies the monetary value of premature death, hospital treatment, lost working days and other health costs caused by particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Indoor air pollution was not taken into account.\n\nResearchers at the consultancy CE Delft used Eurostat pollution and demographic data from 2018 and WHO recommendations. The study is published by the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA), a network affiliating healthcare NGOs across Europe.\n\nThe 130 million inhabitants of the cities investigated by the study suffer more than \u00a3150bn of damage a year, with an average cost of \u00a3349m per city. Pollution-related deaths contribute 76% of the costs, with diseases accounting for the rest. However, costs are thought to be underestimated because several cities under-report their level of pollution.\n\nDiesel vehicles are one of the main contributors to the damage. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal in 2015, diesel cars and lorries were found to exceed EU limits for emissions that are the primary source of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Moreover, diesel models older than the Euro 6 standard generally emit more particulate matter (PM) than other fossil-fuel engines, and also make up the largest share of the European fleet.\n\nNO2, PM and ground-level ozone (O3) \u2013 also largely derived from diesel \u2013 are responsible for nearly 500,000 premature deaths across Europe every year. Researchers focused on these three contaminants and concluded that PM is responsible for the vast majority of the social costs (82.5% on average), compared with NO2 (15%) and O3 (2.5%).\n\nLondon suffers the highest social cost, at \u00a310.32bn a year, well ahead of other European cities such as Bucharest (\u00a35.75bn), Berlin (\u00a34.75bn), Warsaw (\u00a33.83bn), Rome (\u00a33.76bn) and Paris (\u00a33.18bn).\n\nCity size, combined with pollution level, is a key factor contributing to total social costs. The larger the population affected by high pollution levels, the higher the proportion of people who lose working days and have a shorter life expectancy.\n\nThe costs per capita and relative to income also vary among cities. On average, every European town dweller pays more than \u00a31,156 a year, equating to 3.9% of household income. Poorer cities tend to lose a higher share of income, with losses reaching 10% in highly polluted and densely populated cities in central and eastern Europe, where wages are lower.\n\nIn the UK, the cost per city dweller is \u00a3905, representing 2.7% of average annual income. London tops the list of UK cities with costs of \u00a31,173 per person, while residents of Plymouth bear the lowest costs of the cities studied, at \u00a3562 per capita.\n\nThe study shows that transport policies can influence the costs incurred by air pollution from roads. For example, a 1% higher average duration of the drive to work increases damage from PM10 by 0.29% and from NO2 by 0.54%.\n\nMany countries plan to bring in bans on the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2030, including Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, while the UK\u2019s current target is 2035 and France has a target of 2040. This will reduce the levels of some pollutants, though electric cars still produce significant amounts of particulate pollution through tyre and brake wear.\n\nAir pollution levels in most cities around Europe are at illegal levels. In an attempt to reduce the pollution and the associated costs, many cities have also increasingly started to allocate more space for sustainable modes of transport such as walking and cycling, as well as increasing investment in public transport.\n\nThis story was supported by the European Data Journalist Network",

        "article": "In 1802, when French naturalist Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9ron slipped a small, chunky Australian fish into a jar of preservative, little did he suspect that his unassuming prize would be the only member of its species ever known to science. The smooth handfish (Sympterichthys unipennis) was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List earlier this year. This strange and spiny bottom-dweller made history with its passing. It became the first marine bony fish to be listed as extinct in modern times. Today, all that remains of the species is that discoloured specimen in the Natural History Museum in Paris.\n\nScooped up off the coast of south-east Tasmania, P\u00e9ron\u2019s catch was one of the 14 handfish species living in southern Australian waters at the time. The relatives of the smooth handfish are a colourful family which crawl around the seafloor using adapted fins as \u201chands\u201d. They look like grumpy ageing punks, each sporting a dorsal fin over its head like a mohawk, bulging eyes and a cantankerous expression.\n\nThe smooth handfish, which was declared extinct earlier this year but undoubtedly died out long before that. Photograph: CSIRO\n\nAs a family, they have a lot to be grumpy about. Since colonisation, human activity has caused their numbers to plummet. Seven species have not been seen for more than 20 years and three Tasmanian species, the spotted, red and Ziebell\u2019s handfish, are listed as critically endangered.\n\n\u201cThe smooth handfish must have been relatively common to be among the first species collected on the continent,\u201d says Prof Graham Edgar, a marine biologist at the University of Tasmania, whose work contributed to the IUCN listing. With no living specimens to study, Edgar and his colleagues have had to infer much of what we know about the species from P\u00e9ron\u2019s records.\n\nAnother Tasmanian species, Ziebell\u2019s handfish, is also critically endangered. Photograph: Andrew Green\n\nP\u00e9ron was on board the G\u00e9ographe, a vessel fitted out for research that was captained by Nicolas Baudin and sent to the southern continent by Napoleon. Collection methods were limited to lines, shallow water dip nets and seine nets. \u201cNo handfish has ever been caught by line,\u201d explains Edgar, meaning the fish was most likely to have been caught with a seine or dip net, suggesting it was a shallow water species.\n\nIf smooth handfish were so plentiful that P\u00e9ron could easily scoop one up in his net, why did they disappear?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to single out this or that particular cause,\u201d says Edgar. However, he believes that historical dredging for scallops and oysters, sediment runoff from industry and climate change are the most likely causes for the extinction. Local ecosystems have been dramatically degraded by these factors. \u201cAbout 40% of shallow reef species in southern Tasmania are showing rapid population decline, the whole marine system in the south-east has changed substantially in the last 100 years,\u201d he says.\n\nThe red handfish, the third of the Tasmanian species that is listed as critically endangered. Photograph: Rick Stuart-Smith\n\nWith sea temperatures increasing at about four times the global average, climate change is hitting south-east Tasmania hard. This has created what Edgar describes as a \u201cclimate trap\u201d for coastal marine life. As warm water moves south, species that require cold, shallow water are losing habitat. \u201cThe loss of the smooth handfish is potentially part of a much bigger issue, as a large number of other species have dwindling populations and are heading towards extinction in this cold temperate location.\u201d\n\nExtinctions are often caused by cumulative factors, agrees Dr Tim Lynch, former chair of the National Handfish Recovery Team (NHRT) and a senior researcher at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. When musing on the smooth handfish, he points to the destruction of the shellfish reefs which were once a dominant feature of south-east Tasmanian seas. These reefs were ripped apart by a rapacious oyster and scallop dredging operation in the early 20th century.\n\nA diver takes a closer look at a Ziebell\u2019s handfish. Photograph: Andrew Green\n\nThe catastrophic biodiversity loss witnessed by this region was revealed by comparing core samples taken from these dredging sites. Sediment samples from 1890 show a mean of 21 bivalve species, whereas the 1990 samples contain a mean of seven.\n\nThe shellfish industry collapsed within decades, but Lynch explains that the reefs\u2019 capacity to recover has been hindered by the northern Pacific sea star (Asterias amurensis) \u2013 a ravenous, predatory species, introduced via ship ballast to southern waters. \u201cThat\u2019s the habitat that the soft sediment species of handfish would have thrived in, but it\u2019s gone now,\u201d Lynch says.\n\nAlthough the smooth handfish had not being sighted for more than 200 years, it took Edgar, Lynch and their colleagues decades of doggedly surveying the marine diversity of southern Australia before they were confident beyond reasonable doubt it was extinct.\n\nUntil recently there was always the slight hope that there might be a remnant population or individuals clinging to survival. \u201cIf the smooth handfish were a mammal, bird, reptile or plant it would have been listed as extinct years ago. Because it was a marine species there\u2019s always been that element of doubt,\u201d Edgar says.\n\nThe last smooth handfish probably perished decades before the species was declared extinct, which raises the question: have other marine fish gone extinct without us knowing?\n\nA spotted handfish in a Tasmanian estuary, south-eastern Australia. Photograph: Nigel Marsh/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\u201cAlmost certainly,\u201d says Lynch. \u201cThe likelihood that [species] have not come to the notice of western science before they have become extinct is quite high.\u201d This is because marine biodiversity is so broad, and surveying the sea is a harder task. He emphasises that marine plants and invertebrates might also be in more trouble than records such as the Red List suggest.\n\nEdgar agrees that a lack of data might be veiling the true extent of biodiversity loss in the ocean. He points to more thoroughly researched marine life such as corals, sharks and groupers. He says: \u201cWhen you look at these groups the number of threatened species is actually similar in the sea to on land.\u201d\n\nThe underrepresentation of marine fish on the Red List has led to the comfortable assumption that marine fish are in less trouble than their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts. The landmark listing of the smooth handfish as extinct shows us that the ocean is not too vast to be touched by the extinction crisis.\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "article": "Some of the solutions sound fantastical \u2013 but their proponents argue that there are precious few other options\n\nTime is running out for the Arctic. The region continues to warm at two or three times the global rate and scientists now predict that we could see Arctic summer ice disappear as early as 2042.\n\nAs the realization sets in that existing emission reductions and renewable energy programs in place won\u2019t be enough to save the Arctic, alternative geoengineering projects have gained traction as scientists look for a last-ditch solution. Some of them sound fantastical \u2013 but their proponents argue that there are precious few other options.\n\nA layer of glass beads\n\nThe Arctic region suffers from a feedback loop called the albedo effect where melting snow and ice exposes darker ocean which absorbs more heat from the sun and in turn melts more ice. To reverse this effect, a non-profit called Arctic Ice Project has proposed sprinkling parts of the Arctic with a thin layer of glass beads that would boost surface reflectivity and create more ice, potentially starting a cooling feedback loop.\n\nThe beads are 35 micrometres in diameter and made from silica; a compound made up of oxygen and silicon, which is supposed to reflect 90% of the sun\u2019s heat. Arctic Ice Project has tested the beads on ice-covered lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Minnesota and Alaska and initial results have shown that they do increase ice reflectivity and thickness. Now, Leslie Field, the founder of the group, is targeting critical parts of the Arctic region, in particular the Fram Strait which lies between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard. Such an operation would cost about $300m, according to the Arctic Ice Project team.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arctic Ice Project\u2019s solution, which can be thought of as a type of floating white sand, is made from a silicate glass which is mostly silicon dioxide. Photograph: Courtesy of Arctic Ice Project\n\nUnderwater sea walls\n\nIn 2018, John C Moore and Rupert Gladstone of the Arctic Centre, University of Lapland proposed a geoengineering project that would aim to slow the melt of fast-moving outlet glaciers such as the Thwaites glacier in western Antarctica and Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland.\n\nThe idea involves the construction of a sea wall or a free-floating design that could block the warm ocean currents from melting the glacier from below. \u201cIf you can turn the melting off, the ice shelf can re-ground\u201d explains Moore. In the case of the Jakobshavn glacier, which drains about 7% of Greenland\u2019s entire ice sheet, a barrier could be constructed across Ilulissat Fjord to block warm ocean currents reaching its lower reaches.\n\nRewilding the Arctic tundra\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man plays with a baby moose at the Pleistocene Park outside of Cherskiy, Siberia, in 2018. The park is a large-scale scientific experiment created by Sergey Zimov and run by his son Nikita Zimov. Photograph: Katie Orlinsky\n\nThe family-run Pleistocene Park project has gradually reintroduced the mammoth steppe grassland ecosystem to swaths of Arctic tundra in northern Siberia over the past two decades. The project aims to reduce permafrost thaw in the Arctic, which emits a mixture of methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide \u2013 all greenhouse gases.\n\nThis process of rewilding was made possible by the introduction of large grazing animals such as bison, reindeer and horses that can re-engineer the landscape by trampling on or eating tree saplings. These large herbivores also trample on the snow cover, reducing its insulating effect and exposing the layer of permafrost below to colder temperatures.\n\nAccording to a preliminary study inspired by the Pleistocene Park project, increasing the population and density of big herbivores in northern high-latitude ecosystems could preserve 80% of the world\u2019s permafrost.\n\nMillions of wind-powered pumps\n\nPerhaps the most ambitious geoengineering proposal to date is the construction of 10m wind-powered pumps throughout the Arctic that would continually distribute seawater on to surface ice where it would then freeze. The idea, initially proposed in 2017 by researchers in the American Geophysical Union\u2019s journal Earth\u2019s Future aimed to both increase the amount of ice in the Arctic as well as reduce the albedo effect by creating a thicker layer of ice which would survive the summer melt.\n\nIn 2019, researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute used a climate model to test the approach. Their findings showed that the use of wind-powered pumps would delay the total-loss of summertime sea ice for a few decades but that it did not offer a permanent solution.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nasa students launch high-altitude balloons in Casper College, Wyoming, in 2017.

Photograph: Gene Blevins/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSolar geoengineering\n\nIn recent years, solar geoengineering has been highlighted as a potential, controversial solution to Arctic warming. The principle behind solar geoengineering is similar to that of the cooling effect that natural events such as volcanic eruptions have on the Earth\u2019s surface, when they release particles into the atmosphere that block solar radiation.\n\nThe most high-profile solar geoengineering program is Harvard University\u2019s Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx), which looks to explore the idea of reflecting the sun\u2019s heat by releasing calcium carbonate into the stratosphere. Harvard researchers, David Keith and Frank Keutsch plan to run initial tests by releasing small amounts of the aerosol into the stratosphere using a high-altitude scientific balloon.\n\nThe idea that one day enough of this aerosol could be injected into the stratosphere to reflect the sun\u2019s heat has raised several environmental concerns, including potential damage to the ozone layer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man works on a pipe beside a carbon injection site well near Reykjavik Energy\u2019s Hellisheidi geothermal power plant in 2017 outside Reykjavik, Iceland. To offset global warming, since 2007, scientists have collaborated with Reykjavik energy\u2019s experts, technicians, and tradespeople on developing the idea and implementation of fixating CO2 into basaltic rock. Photograph: Melanie Stetson Freeman/The Christian Science Monitor via Getty Images\n\nTurning CO 2 into Icelandic rocks\n\nAt a geothermal power plant in Hellisheidi, Iceland \u2013 which is considered an Arctic state \u2013 researchers have produced a unique form of carbon capture by injecting emissions from the plant into basalt rock. The project, CarbFix, was headed by Reykjavik Energy and was successfully completed without any emissions leaking. The carbon was entirely converted into an organic non-polluting part of the Icelandic rock.\n\nAfter the success of the first project, the CarbFix2 initiative aims to up-scale carbon capture from several hundred tonnes per year to several million tonnes per year. .\n\nPeat expansion to cool the Arctic tundra\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Water from the Greenland ice sheet flows through heather and peat as the Eqip Sermia glacier stands behind during unseasonably warm weather in Greenland in 2019. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nOne solution to Arctic warming could occur naturally as its ecosystems are altered by global warming.\n\nIn recent years, northern parts of Canada, Siberia and Alaska have become greener, potentially creating the right conditions for a peat-rich landscape. Peat moss \u2013 or sphagnum \u2013 that grows in the Arctic tundra is a known carbon sink, which means it absorbs more carbon than it releases.\n\nResearchers using high-resolution carbon dating and paleoecological records are now studying the expansion and development of peat in the Arctic tundra and the implications of an increase in peat on the region\u2019s carbon cycle. Although a greener Arctic is ultimately a negative effect of climate change, if peat moss was able to flourish, the tundra could potentially offset some of the effects of climate change in the region.",

Drivers in boroughs such as Newham and Tower Hamlets are also less likely than residents of south-west London to live in houses with driveways that allow them to charge electric vehicles overnight.\n\nJamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said the \u00a35m funding would be invested by 2023 in areas that lack the charging infrastructure they need to support electric vehicles, with the firm looking to work with the borough councils in Newham, Brent and Tower Hamlets to decide how it should be spent.\n\nHe said: \u201cDrivers consistently tell us that having reliable, accessible charging near where they live is a key factor when deciding if they should switch to electric.\n\n\u201cIf we address this challenge for professional drivers now, it will help create a mass market for electric vehicles in the years to come. As we all know this is critical if the UK is to achieve our goal to be net zero.\u201d\n\nOnly about 1,000 Uber vehicles in London are fully electric \u2013 a long way short of the firm\u2019s pledge that all 45,000 cars on its app in the capital should be electric by 2025.\n\nLondon is nonetheless where Uber is spearheading its ambition for zero-emission fleets worldwide by 2040. It struck a deal with Nissan earlier this year to supply 2,000 discounted Leafs for London drivers.\n\nUber is sitting on a fund of more than \u00a3100m raised through its self-imposed clean air fee in London, designed to help drivers transition to electric cars. The 15p per mile levy on passengers was announced in 2018 as Uber attempted to restore its battered corporate image, after Transport for London refused it a licence.\n\nMagistrates again granted a licence for Uber to continue operating in London last month after a court ruled it \u201cno longer posed a risk\u201d, a year after Transport for London refused for a second time to extend its licence over safety concerns.",

        "article": "One of the most senior executives at the Environment Agency is leaving to join a water company that is under criminal investigation by the watchdog.\n\nThe departure of Dr Toby Willison, the director of operations for the EA, to take up a role at Southern Water has angered campaigners seeking to reduce pollution in rivers and coastal waters. Willison has previously been the acting chief executive of the environmental watchdog.\n\nThe EA has been investigating Southern Water over serious failures in the operation of its sewage treatment sites. Last year Ofwat fined Southern Water and ordered it to pay reparations to customers in a \u00a3126m penalty package. Ofwat found the company had deliberately misreported data about the performance of its wastewater treatment works, which led to unauthorised premature spills of untreated waste.\n\nDocuments submitted to the regulator revealed that employees at the company would routinely drive tanker-loads of sewage from one waste treatment plant to another to dodge water-quality inspections by EAofficials as part of deliberate manipulation of data to avoid millions of pounds in fines.\n\nIn March, Southern pleaded guilty at Maidstone crown court to 51 charges brought by the EA of dumping poisonous, noxious substances including raw sewage, after a criminal inquiry that ran alongside the Ofwat investigations. Sentencing in the criminal case is due in February.\n\nAn EA spokesperson said the criminal investigation into Southern was ongoing. This month the EA chastised water companies including Southern over the worst levels of environmental pollution in five years.\n\nThe agency said Willison was leaving at the end of November to take up the Southern role. A spokesperson for the EA and Willison said \u201cclear rules around conflict of interest\u201d were put into place as soon as he decided to take up the new job. They would not go into detail about the measures taken, but said: \u201cDuring [Willison\u2019s] notice period he has stepped out of all relevant water company discussions and decision-making. He remains bound by and understands his ongoing duty of confidentiality once he takes up his new job.\u201d\n\nStuart Singleton-White, the head of campaigns at the Angling Trust, said the agency had too often been too slow to act and to hold water companies to account. \u201cBy jumping ship from the EA to Southern Water, Dr Willison is shining a light on the cosy relationship between these companies and those who are supposed to be regulating them on behalf of consumers and our rivers,\u201d he said. \u201cI can only hope he has more impact inside the company and demands his new employer does more to clean up its act and protect our precious rivers and chalk streams.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Southern Water said it hired Willison after an opportunity arose to recruit a high-calibre candidate. The company said Willison was taking the role of natural capital and environment director. It said his job signalled a strengthening of focus on environment and sustainable capital programmes while continuing to build effective working partnerships with key stakeholders, regulators and government.\n\nWillison also holds a role as a board member of British Water, which he took up last May. British Water is a trade body that lobbies and campaigns on behalf of the water industry.\n\nAshley Smith, who campaigns to stop sewage releases by water companies, said: \u201cThe more we have looked into the regulation of the water industry, the more appalled we have become. The industry is definitely in charge, with the regulators providing little more than false public assurance, misleading comments and token prosecutions.\u201d",

        "article": "Bottle-fed babies are swallowing millions of microplastic particles a day, according to research described as a \u201cmilestone\u201d in the understanding of human exposure to tiny plastics.\n\nScientists found that the recommended high-temperature process for sterilising plastic bottles and preparing formula milk caused bottles to shed millions of microplastics and trillions of even smaller nanoplastics.\n\nThe polypropylene bottles tested make up 82% of the world market, with glass bottles being the main alternative. Polypropylene is one of the most commonly used plastics and preliminary tests by the scientists found kettles and food containers also produced millions of microplastics per litre of liquid.\n\nMicroplastics in the environment were already known to contaminate human food and drink, but the study shows that food preparation in plastic containers can lead to exposure thousands of times higher.\n\nThe health impacts are unknown and the scientists say there is an \u201curgent need\u201d to assess the issue, particularly for infants. The team has also produced sterilisation guidelines to reduce microplastic exposure.\n\nProf John Boland, at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, said \u201cwe were absolutely gobsmacked\u201d at the number of microplastics produced by the baby bottles. \u201cA study last year by the World Health Organization estimated adults would consume between 300 and 600 microplastics a day \u2013 our average values were on the order of a million or millions.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have to start doing the health studies to understand the implications. We\u2019re already working with colleagues to look at what buttons in the immune system these particles begin to press.\u201d\n\nHe said many of the particles would simply be excreted but further investigation was needed into how many could be absorbed into the bloodstream and travel to other parts of the body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already gotten rid of all those [food] containers I used to use and if I had young children I would modify how I prepare [milk formula],\u201d Boland said. \u201cThe message is the precautionary principle.\u201d\n\nPhilipp Schwabl, at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria and not part of the research team, said: \u201cThese findings represent an important milestone. The scale of microplastic exposure presented here may seem alarming, but the real-world effects on infant health require further investigation.\u201d\n\nProf Oliver Jones, at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, noted the babies\u2019 exposure levels were estimates, not measurements: \u201cWe should not be making parents feel bad for using plastic bottles. However, this study illustrates that the microplastics problem is likely much bigger than we think [and] something we need to start really getting to grips with.\u201d\n\nPeople were already known to consume microplastics via food and water, and to breathe them in. In particular, tea brewed using plastic-based teabags and drinking water sold in plastic bottles have been found to contain microplastics. Scientists are concerned that microplastics may carry pathogens or toxic chemicals into the body.\n\nRevealed: microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers Read more\n\nMicroplastics from plastic waste have polluted the entire planet, from Arctic snow and Alpine soils to the deepest oceans. But Prof Liwen Xiao at Trinity College said: \u201cOur study indicates that plastic products are an important source of microplastics, meaning the routes of exposure are much closer to us than previously thought.\u201d\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Food, began with an accidental finding when one researcher who was developing filters found they kept getting clogged with microplastics. These were subsequently traced back to polypropylene lab equipment.\n\nThe team followed international sterilisation guidelines to make baby formula in 10 different feeding bottles. This involves sterilising with 95C (203F) water, then shaking the formula powder with 70C water in the bottle.\n\nBoth the hot water and shaking steps produced a lot of microplastics, which are far smaller than the width of a human hair. Nanoplastics are so small they are very hard to count, but the scientists estimated trillions were produced per litre of fluid.\n\nThe scientists combined their experimental data with rates of bottle-feeding and milk intake in 48 regions, covering three-quarters of the global population. On average, they estimated that babies are exposed to 1.6m microplastic particles a day during their first year when fed using plastic bottles. The US, Australia and European countries had the highest levels \u2013 more than 2m particles per day, due to higher levels of bottle feeding.\n\nThe scientists suggest an additional washing step can cut the microplastics produced during usual formula preparation. Water boiled in a non-plastic container and then cooled is used to rinse the bottle three times after sterilisation. The formula is also made in a non-plastic container, then cooled and poured into the clean bottle.\n\n\u201cThat will dramatically reduce the number of microplastics,\u201d said Boland. \u201cThe last thing we want is to unduly alarm parents, particularly when we don\u2019t have sufficient information on the potential [health] consequences. However, we are calling on policymakers to reassess the current guidelines for formula preparation when using plastic infant feeding bottles.\u201d\n\nOther solutions include using glass bottles, though these are heavier for babies to hold and are breakable, and developing tough new coatings to prevent plastics shedding particles.\n\nBoland said plastics were \u201cwonderful\u201d materials with many useful applications: \u201cSo the reality is they\u2019re here to stay and we will have to make them safer and more resilient.\u201d",

        "summary": "Scientists found that the recommended high-temperature process for sterilising plastic bottles and preparing formula milk caused bottles to shed millions of microplastics and trillions of even smaller nanoplastics.\nProf John Boland, at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, said \u201cwe were absolutely gobsmacked\u201d at the number of microplastics produced by the baby bottles.\nIn particular, tea brewed using plastic-based teabags and drinking water sold in plastic bottles have been found to contain microplastics.\nOn average, they estimated that babies are exposed to 1.6m microplastic particles a day during their first year when fed using plastic bottles.\nThe scientists suggest an additional washing step can cut the microplastics produced during usual formula preparation.",

        "article": "The storms in September have dredged from the sea bottom and then flung millions of razor shells across the immense space of this beach. As I kneeled to examine a cluster, half-buried in sand by continued westerlies, I noticed that every shell was an exact analogue of its wider environment. Because each blade bore wavering bands of variant colour crosswise through its length.\n\nThe same pattern was manifest not only in the sand ribs that continued across these vast flats, it was there also at the tide edge, where a broad curve of foam, which was turned to tin by the dazzling light, was smeared inexorably eastwards in the breeze and the froth was itself banded into the same highly transient design.\n\nIt occurred to me that this one engrained sea shape \u2013 fashioned by the unending rhythm of the waves \u2013 is a perpetual background to the lives of the waders feeding there. They were sanderlings: dumpy, 100g white balls of ceaseless sea-like energy. The author Peter Matthiessen memorably named them \u201cwind birds\u201d for their wandering lives. He also called them \u201ctireless toy birds\u201d in honour of that hilarious, speeded-up trotting motion of their short black legs, with which each sanderling skirts the edge of the next incoming wave.\n\nThere is a curious paradox at work in the sameness of the sanderlings\u2019 environment. They may dwell within this singular tidal pattern all their lives, but it is a landscape that winds around the margins of land everywhere on Earth. Sanderlings that breed in northernmost Greenland can winter in Namibia. Those that nest at the rim of terra firma in Arctic Canada follow this intertidal margin all the way to Tierra del Fuego.\n\nThere is barely a beach anywhere on Earth where sanderlings do not feed. I looked randomly through a shelf of field guides \u2013 for Hawaii, the Solomons Island, New Zealand, Peru and Papua New Guinea \u2013 and in all I found this inhabitant of the line between sand and sea. As I watch them making their wind-blown walks at the water\u2019s edge, I cherish the comedy in this clockwork bird but sense also that there is grandeur in a life so at one with the pulse of the ocean.",

        "article": "The vast majority of protected landscapes across Europe are rated as in poor or bad condition and vital species and their habitats continue to decline despite targets aimed at protecting them, according to a report.\n\nOnly a quarter of Europe\u2019s species are rated as having a good conservation status, while 80% of key habitats are rated as being in poor or bad condition across the continent, in the State of Nature in the EU 2013-2018 assessment by the European Environment Agency.\n\nJust under half of all bird species are thriving, at 47%, but this is a decline of five percentage points since 2015, showing that the trend is going in the wrong direction.\n\nVirginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, said: \u201c[This] shows very clearly that we are still losing our vital life support system. We urgently need to deliver on the commitments in the new EU biodiversity strategy to reverse this decline for the benefit of nature, people, climate and the economy.\u201d\n\nMuch of the blame for the poor condition of Europe\u2019s natural environment lies with intensive farming. The EU\u2019s common agricultural policy (CAP) tends to reward intensive farming, despite moves to reward farmers for some measures that prioritise the environment.\n\n\u201cThe pressures on nature are much greater than the solutions we are currently providing,\u201d said Micheal O\u2019Briain, of the European commission\u2019s nature protection unit. \u201cAgriculture on balance is still putting huge pressure on nature.\u201d\n\nReforms that would reward farmers for doing more for the environment are under discussion, as part of the \u201cfarm to fork\u201d strategy and the European Green Deal, but some face opposition from farmers\u2019 groups in some member states. \u201cI would not pretend this is going to be an easy debate [on CAP reform] as we have somehow to reconcile different objectives,\u201d O\u2019Briain said.\n\nKey votes on CAP reform will take place this week in the European parliament, but two of the largest groupings of MEPs on the political right have come together to reject many of the measures that would prioritise environmental protections. Jabier Ruiz, senior policy officer at WWF, said: \u201cAs it stands, the future of the CAP looks grim. Neither council nor parliament appear to care about the climate and biodiversity crises as they strip away conditions for farm subsidies and push for greenwashing loopholes. Policy-makers must hit the emergency brakes and change direction before it is too late.\u201d\n\nCampaigners are also calling for member states\u2019 environment ministers to endorse the EU\u2019s 2030 biodiversity strategy later in the week.\n\nThe EU\u2019s habitats directive lists 233 key habitat types, covering nearly a third of the EU\u2019s land area, and only 15% of these are rated as in good condition. Coastal habitats, dunes and bog, mire and fen come out worst, according to Europe\u2019s environment watchdog, though forest habitats are faring slightly better.\n\nThere has been little sign of improvement over most of the past decade, despite EU targets. Overall, about a third of listed habitats are in an unfavourable condition and deteriorating, with a similar number unfavourable but stable.\n\nAmong species types, reptiles and vascular plants are faring best, though half are still rated as in poor or bad condition, while the fate of mammals is showing improvement but for about half of fish species the outlook is unfavourable and deteriorating.\n\nHarmless or vicious hunter? The uneasy return of Europe's wolves Read more\n\nThere are a few bright spots. Rewilding in some areas has brought wolves back as far as Germany and Belgium, though not without concerns from farmers and rural communities. Some bird species, such as the red kite and crane, have been improving markedly, and there has been good news for the ruddy shelduck and black guillemot. Sweden\u2019s agile frog is on the up, as is the bearded vulture across the continent. The EEA also singled out the Italian wall lizard, the horseshoe whip snake, the hairy agrimony and the great yellow gentian as conservation success stories.\n\nHans Bruyninckx, executive director of the EEA, called on EU member states to do more to reach the bloc\u2019s biodiversity targets. \u201cOur assessment shows that safeguarding the health and resilience of Europe\u2019s nature, and people\u2019s wellbeing, requires fundamental changes to the way we produce and consume food, manage and use forests, and build cities,\u201d he said. \u201cThese efforts need to be coupled with better implementation and enforcement of conservation policies, a focus on nature restoration, as well as increasingly ambitious climate action, especially in the transport and energy sector.\u201d\n\nAgriculture is not the only problem: a lack of water in some areas, urbanisation and pollution are also harming wildlife and plants. Forestry is also showing mixed impacts, as some forests are thriving but in some areas forest management and clear-cutting are destroying habitats.\n\nBirds face the additional pressure of hunting, which still accounts for at least 52 million bird deaths a year, and fish populations are under pressure from the common fisheries policy, reforms to which have not been fully implemented despite the 2020 deadline in law for bringing fishing quotas into line with scientific advice.\n\nThe assessment, published on Monday, was based on the work of 200,000 people, of whom about 60% were volunteers, reporting data to the EEA, and represents the largest dataset on nature ever compiled in Europe.\n\nThe UK will no longer be bound by the EU directives under Brexit, and is leaving the common agricultural policy. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said: \u201cWe are moving to a fairer system now we have left the EU, with our agriculture bill fulfilling our ambitious plans for a system based on the principle of public money for public goods, such as improving air and water quality and driving biodiversity. We have consulted on this and have announced our intention to start phasing out the existing, unfair direct payment system in England from 2021.\u201d",

But the fossil fuels it and others produce are leading to global heating, and the Arctic is melting. The firm\u2019s drilling infrastructure could be at risk atop thawing and unstable permafrost.\n\nA recent environmental review of the project describes the company\u2019s solution: cooling devices that will chill the ground beneath its structures, insulating them from the effects of the climate crisis.\n\nThe oil development that is fueling climate change continues to expand in the far north, with companies moving into new areas even as they are paying for special measures to protect equipment from the dangers of thawing permafrost and increasing rainfall \u2013 both expected outcomes as Arctic temperatures rise three times as fast as those elsewhere.\n\nCountries from Norway to Russia are advancing new Arctic oil developments. But under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Alaska has emerged as a hotbed of Arctic oil extraction, with big projects moving forward and millions of acres proposed to be opened to leasing.\n\nThe administration recently finalized its plan to open a piece of the Arctic national wildlife refuge to the oil industry. And drilling is expanding at an Indiana-sized region next door: the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, which, despite its name, also contains treasured subsistence areas for locals.\n\nCritics of Arctic oil expansion argue that while companies can use technology to temporarily and locally dampen climate disruptions, the region\u2019s indigenous residents cannot. And even some who support oil development in the region argue that the Trump administration\u2019s plans go too far.\n\nAt the start of Trump\u2019s term, the mayor of the oil-rich North Slope borough, an I\u00f1upiaq whale hunter named Harry Brower Jr, endorsed the federal government\u2019s plans to push development forward in the Arctic refuge and in the petroleum reserve.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Satelite imagery of the Prudhoe Bay oilfields in North Slope borough, Alaska. Photograph: Orbital Horizon/Copernicus Sentinel Data 2020/Gallo Images via Getty Images\n\nTaxes on infrastructure at the huge Prudhoe Bay oilfield help generate nearly $400m a year for the 10,000-person borough, which is almost all of its revenue.\n\nThree years after Brower\u2019s endorsement, the administration released a rewritten management plan that would vastly expand the share of the petroleum reserve open to oil companies: four-fifths of the area would be available, up from roughly half now.\n\nBut the proposal also would allow oil and gas leasing at Teshekpuk Lake, which Brower had asked the Trump administration to keep off-limits. The lake, in tandem with nearby wetlands, is considered one of the most important animal habitats in the entire Arctic, and the region\u2019s indigenous residents harvest its abundant fish and wildlife.\n\nFreezing cold war: militaries move in as Arctic ice retreats \u2013 photo essay Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like God\u2019s country,\u201d said George Ahmaogak Sr, a former mayor of the North Slope borough, who has built three subsistence fishing cabins not far from the lake. \u201cI\u2019ve lived there, I\u2019ve seen it and I subsisted on it, and it\u2019s beautiful \u2013 resources are bountiful there.\u201d\n\nThe lake hosts birds that come from all seven continents. Molting geese, unable to fly, try to avoid predators by forming rafts in the middle of lakes, sometimes by the thousands. And hundreds, even thousands, of migrating caribou travel along Teshekpuk Lake\u2019s shore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an environmentalist or anything like that \u2013 I\u2019ve been pro-development all these years,\u201d Ahmaogak said. \u201cBut Teshekpuk is a concern of mine, and I wanted to see it protected.\u201d\n\nThe North Slope is already warming at disconcerting speed. Utqiagvik, the region\u2019s hub town, is one of the fastest-warming communities in the nation, with its five record warmest winters all coming since 2014.\n\nAmid record high temperatures and record low sea ice last year, crews in Utqiagvik had to wait weeks longer than usual for the arrival of the bowhead whales that they hunt \u2013 and which make up a substantial portion of North Slope residents\u2019 diets.\n\nAmid that rapid change, the oil industry is enjoying a renaissance in the region, in part thanks to technologies enabling infrastructure to withstand climatic shifts. Such technology is decades old, but veterans of the oil industry say that demand for it is becoming more ubiquitous and intense as the Arctic heats up.\n\nOne Alaska company, BeadedStream, sells equipment that measures and transmits tundra temperature data, so that the oil industry can know as soon as it is frozen solid enough to transport equipment, according to National Public Radio. Another firm, Arctic Foundations, is doing increasingly brisk business selling thermosiphons \u2013 the tubes that pull heat out of the ground to keep permafrost from thawing underneath oil infrastructure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thermosiphons installed at the Nikaitchuq oilfield on Alaska\u2019s North Slope, where they cool the ground and keep permafrost from thawing beneath a warehouse. Photograph: Courtesy of Arctic Foundation\n\nConocoPhillips plans to make use of these devices at its massive Willow project in the National Petroleum Reserve, and it\u2019s also building taller bridges and wider culverts to accommodate larger spring floods.\n\nThe backers of another new project, meanwhile, see opportunity in the thaw. The melting of Arctic sea ice removes an obstacle from shipping liquefied natural gas off Alaska\u2019s North Slope, according to the Anchorage-based company, Qilak LNG.\n\n\u201cOur reliability quotient goes up,\u201d said Mead Treadwell, the Republican businessman and former Alaska lieutenant governor who has helped to spearhead the project. \u201cClimate change, the changing composition of sea ice, has made this more economic.\u201d\n\nAt Teshekpuk Lake, the Trump administration says it can protect the region\u2019s caribou, birds and fish with tight restrictions and time frames for drilling and development. No infrastructure would be allowed on or next to the lake itself; companies would have to drill horizontally to access it.\n\nThat\u2019s not enough for conservation groups, which sued to block the rewritten plan in August.\n\n\u201cOut of all the places in the world, the Arctic is changing the fastest,\u201d said Natalie Dawson, the head of the Audubon Society\u2019s Alaska branch. \u201cSo, we might want to give ourselves a little bit of room to figure out what we want to protect.\u201d\n\nQaiyaan Harcharek, a 38-year-old I\u00f1upiaq hunter, fisherman and trapper, said he is disgusted by the Teshekpuk proposal. He called the area a \u201cguaranteed food source\u201d that his ancestors turned to in times of starvation.\n\nOpening Teshekpuk, Harcharek said, is \u201cabsolutely reckless and dangerous\u201d.",

We look forward to working with the government to make this happen,\u201d she said.\n\nResearchers at the Grantham Institute, part of the London School of Economics (LSE), have called for ministers to plough \u00a320bn in paid cash towards a new national investment bank to establish a pipeline of clean infrastructure projects including carbon capture and hydrogen.\n\nThe new report, commissioned by the Aldersgate Group, proposed the state-backed bank alongside a string of near-term public investments and long-term, low-carbon strategies.\n\nThe recommendations include funding for energy efficiency upgrades, tree planting and wetland restoration to boost Britain\u2019s green recovery and help create new jobs and training opportunities.\n\nThe report\u2019s four-prong approach also set out a \u201clow carbon skills\u201d strategy to level-up workers who might be left underemployed or unemployed following the pandemic, and a long-term framework for low-carbon investment using a rising carbon market price to incentivise private investments.\n\nDimitri Zenghelis, a senior visiting fellow at the LSE and the co-author of the report, said: \u201cThe government has made a good start with the summer statement and early stimulus measures will help shore up a more resilient economy over the next two years. But the government must now turn its rhetoric on green recovery into predictable and credible commitments to build a sustainable economy over next decade and beyond.\u201d",

        "article": "The chancellor of the exchequer must lay out urgent plans to realign government spending with the target to cut carbon emissions to net zero, or risk missing the target and fuelling high carbon emissions for years to come, Labour has urged.\n\nThe warning comes as the Treasury prepares key policy announcements on the UK\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus recession, which Rishi Sunak is expected to set out in his spending review next week.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners are pinning their hopes on the chancellor proving more receptive to a green recovery than the prime minister, after Boris Johnson set out his vision for a \u201cnew deal\u201d this week in which the climate crisis merited barely a mention, but \u201cnewt counting\u201d was singled out as \u201ca drag on productivity\u201d.\n\nWes Streeting, Labour\u2019s shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said a key test for Sunak would be the Treasury\u2019s Green Book, a set of guidelines that governs how ministers and civil servants appraise and evaluate policy, projects and programmes.\n\nStreeting wants to see sweeping reforms. \u201cThe Treasury really is crucial [and] should step up,\u201d he told the Guardian in an interview. \u201cA reform of the Green Book should have net zero writ large, so that the civil servants and ministers making appraisals of policy can take account of whether those policies help or hinder reaching net zero.\u201d\n\nThe Green Book matters because in the past many proposed green policies, such as incentives for low-carbon energy, or infrastructure building, have fallen foul of the Treasury\u2019s criteria on value for money. But if the net zero target, enshrined in law last year, is to be reached then it must also be made a key criterion for the Treasury.\n\n\u201cThey are squandering this opportunity,\u201d said Streeting. \u201cThe government approach to climate change reeks of complacency. But the Committee on Climate Change has warned that they\u2019re not going far enough, fast enough. There is no plan for net zero.\u201d\n\nStreeting also called for the chancellor to put in place a programme of energy efficiency improvements for Britain\u2019s homes: the draughtiest in Europe and a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. On electric vehicles, he said the government needed to provide more incentives to car-owners.\n\nHe urged the chancellor to fund a new green infrastructure bank, that would provide public money and attract private sector investment for big projects such as improving the railways and public transport. The long-awaited national infrastructure strategy has been put off until this autumn, which will also delay net zero plans, he warned.\n\n\u201cThere is no shortage of ideas and recommendations [on how to ensure the economic recovery is in line with the net zero target] but what\u2019s missing is leadership and action,\u201d Streeting said.\n\nIf the government were to bring forward plans for a green recovery, Labour would support them, he pledged. \u201cWe worked constructively with the government on the coronavirus crisis,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cNet zero is a cross-party issue.\u201d\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are also pushing for the government to ensure its spending plans lead to a green recovery, after Johnson\u2019s \u201cnew deal\u201d announcement held little new policy on cutting emissions. The party is hoping for wider backing for a new draft bill that would require the secretary of state to help the 2.6m households in England living in fuel poverty, making fuel bills cheaper and reducing the UK\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nThe private member\u2019s bill would require the government to ensure all fuel-poor households were brought up to energy performance band C by 2030 and all other households to the same band by 2035.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat peer and former MP for Bath, Don Foster, told the Guardian that the government had promised such action on fuel poverty in 2017 but had failed to follow through. \u201cThe prime minister has promised a green recovery to help rescue our economy from the coronavirus crisis \u2013 however, we are yet to see any concrete action,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this government is determined to prove their green recovery is more than just empty promises, they need to be more ambitious. Backing this bill would be a welcome start.\u201d\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe Green Book requires that environmental impacts \u2013 including the impact on our net zero target \u2013 are considered in all government investment decisions. We remain committed to tackling climate change and as our economy reopens following from the coronavirus outbreak we will seeks to drive clean, sustainable growth across all regions. This includes continuing the review of the Green Book and our processes for allocating funding.\u201d\n\nNext week, after the chancellor\u2019s announcement, the UK will be one of the leading participants in a key summit on the green recovery, to be held by the International Energy Agency with the US, China, India, Brazil and the EU participating. The UK will be in the spotlight as host of the next UN climate summit, Cop26, postponed to next year.\n\nStreeting said: \u201cCop26 is the last chance saloon. The UK has a huge responsibility to the rest of the world. But we are clearly behind on Cop26. We need to do more.\u201d",

        "article": "Trillions of dollars will be invested by governments in reviving their economies over the next two or three years. If those dollars are well spent, ensuringlow-carbon, nature-restoring prosperity, we have a real chance of avoiding runaway climate change and ecosystem collapse. If they\u2019re spent on taking us back to pre-coronavirus days, we\u2019re screwed. The climate\u2019s screwed. The planet\u2019s screwed. And all future generations are screwed. It\u2019s as simple \u2013 and as binary \u2013 as that.\n\nThis year was meant to be the year of major breakthroughs in addressing the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis. It will be neither. It will live in the minds of most people as the Year of Covid-19. And rightly so. But those twin emergencies of climate and collapsing ecosystems haven\u2019t gone away while we\u2019ve been straining humankind\u2019s every sinew to mitigate the impacts of the deadliest public health threat in 100 years.\n\nYet what made the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis so urgent before Covid-19 guarantees that they will be even more daunting and even more disruptive at the end of this traumatic year \u2013 with a whole 12 months lost in terms of political engagement and leadership.\n\nIgnore all the over-excited coverage there will no doubt be at the end of this year celebrating a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 10%, towns and cities temporarily purged of the horror of toxic air quality (killing far more people, by the way, every year, than Covid-19 will), and nature back in our lives through the magic of birdsong and wild creatures returning to our denatured urban landscapes. Look on all that as a short-lived respite, a beautiful but evanescent manifestation of how things could be, for citizens the world over. All those silver linings will rapidly disappear unless we start doing things very differently.\n\nA mighty choir of voices (from Prince Charles and Greenpeace to countless multinationals and academics) are now singing from the rooftops to remind our politicians that we have a glorious opportunity to bring forward lasting improvements that would have been unimaginable even six months ago. Their mandate now is crystal clear: restore purchasing power; create new jobs; prioritise the least well-off \u2013 and do all of that in ways that simultaneously make it possible for us to deliver climate stability and a thriving planet.\n\nSo is there any indication that the UK government is thinking in those terms? The short answer is \u201cpossibly\u201d. Beyond the standard waffle from the prime minister (\u201cWe owe it to future generations to \u2018build back better\u2019 and base our recovery on solid foundations, including a fairer, greener and more resilient global economy\u201d), there have been much stronger declarations of intent from both the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury, with specific talk of a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d to create tens of thousands of new jobs.\n\nEven the Department for Transport has been getting in on the act, announcing plans for 2,500 electric charging points along motorways and A-roads by 2030, as well as a \u00a3250m active travel fund to support the development of pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements and cycle- and bus-only corridors \u2013 a down-payment, apparently, on a much bigger programme under consideration.\n\nBut all this is very small beer indeed compared with the plans of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to spend up to \u00a327bn over the next five years to expand Britain\u2019s road network \u2013 locking us into decades of carbon-intensive car dependency at precisely the time when every company in the country is developing post-coronavirus work and travel planning, specifically to reduce car use and commuting, doubling down on more flexible, tech-enabled ways of working.\n\nSo just flip it, Rishi! Transport is the UK\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Hang on to that scale of ambition by making the \u00a327bn available to our cities and towns to invest in cycle lanes, better pedestrian facilities and improved public transport \u2013 as cities such as Bristol and London are already starting to do. This will deliver jobs at the local level (especially in many of our northern cities, which one assumes Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t yet entirely forgotten about), cleaner air and improved health (reducing the burden on the NHS) and potentially massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 10 years.\n\nSimilar, massive benefits are available if the government chooses to invest in a nationwide housing retrofit programme, a pre-existing commitment that has come and gone on several occasions, simply because no previous government ever put its money where its cynically gabby mouth was. As the Green New Deal group has shown, as well as the government\u2019s own Infrastructure Commission, an ambitious retrofit programme means jobs in every constituency (many of them available to young people staring out on a blighted, jobless post-coronavirus world), a huge uptake in construction skills and trades, a rapid reduction in the kind of fuel poverty that has blighted the lives of tens of millions of people (simultaneously costing the NHS billions every year), with significant reductions in greenhouse gas emission by the end of the decade.\n\nOnce the Treasury opens its mind to the potential of a far-reaching Green New Deal, we should also be borrowing unashamedly from President Roosevelt\u2019s original New Deal back in the 1930s by creating a 21st-century equivalent of his Conservation Corps to help restore this nation\u2019s desperately degraded environment. It\u2019s only six months since the major political parties were trying to out-green each other by committing to massive tree-planting programmes in their election manifestos. Since then, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has pretty much sat on its hands.\n\nNothing is ever quite as \u201cshovel-ready\u201d as advocates would have us believe, but local transport solutions, housing retrofits and nature-climate solutions could all be brought forward, at speed and at scale, in ways that would be hugely popular with citizens across the country. There is now not one good reason why this government shouldn\u2019t soon be announcing one of the most ambitious rescue packages anywhere in the world.\n\n\u2022 Jonathon Porritt is an environmentalist and author.

        "article": "People would be prepared to continue many of the lifestyle changes enforced by the coronavirus lockdown to help tackle the climate emergency, and the government would have broad support for a green economic recovery from the crisis, according to a report.\n\nWorking from home is a popular option, along with changes to how people travel, and the government should take the opportunity to rethink investment in infrastructure and support low-carbon industries, the report found.\n\nThe findings come from Climate Assembly UK, a group of 108 members of the public chosen to be representative of the UK population and to help shape future climate policy by discussing options to reach net zero carbon emissions, in line with the government\u2019s 2050 target.\n\nNearly eight in ten of the members said the measures taken by the government to help the economic recovery from Covid-19 should be designed to help reach net zero, and an even bigger proportion \u2013 93% \u2013 said that, as the lockdown eased, the government and employers should encourage lifestyle changes to cut emissions.\n\n\u201cIt was quite clear that many of the assembly members felt this period should be taken as an opportunity to encourage a green economic recovery with a focus on promoting cleaner, greener lifestyles, and an economy that prizes sustainability over short-term benefits that would harm the planet,\u201d said Ibrahim, an assembly member who is a GP from Surrey.\n\n\u201cIt feels that climate change is as big a crisis as Covid,\u201d said one respondent. \u201c[We] don\u2019t want the government to put climate change on the back burner because of Covid.\u201d\n\nAnother unnamed member said: \u201cIt would be too easy to just carry on as before and take advantage of cheap oil and other special offers, [such as] cheap travel, cheap clothes, factories turning out cheap goods, to get the economy going. We need incentives to reduce emissions \u2026 and penalties for people who do not consider the environment when building or rebuilding businesses.\u201d\n\nThe chairs of the six select committees of MPs who commissioned the Climate Assembly wrote to the prime minister on Monday to say the experience of the coronavirus crisis was likely to make people more receptive to green messages from government.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, the UK public has demonstrated its capacity to respond positively and responsibly when they understand the risks posed to them by an invisible threat that demands collective action. We believe that a similar approach, based on securing public support for ambitious policies through open dialogue around the science, is a sound basis for the net zero journey,\u201d they told Boris Johnson in a letter.\n\nQ&A What is a citizen's assembly? Show A citizens\u2019 assembly is a group of people brought together to discuss an issue or issues, and reach a conclusion about what they think should happen, according to the definition put forward by the House of Commons library. Citizens\u2019 assemblies give members of the public the time and opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic, before reaching conclusions. Assembly members are asked to make trade-offs and arrive at workable recommendations. Facilitated by experts and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, members meet over a series of weekends with the goal of removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion. The people who take part are chosen randomly so they reflect the wider population in terms of demographics \u2013 age, gender, ethnicity and social class. The number of members involved can vary. A recent citizens\u2019 assembly, formed to examine social care provision in England, had 47 members who were English citizens and eligible to vote in UK general elections. Citizens\u2019 assemblies, and other similar methods, have been used in the UK and other countries, including Australia, Canada and the US, to address a range of complex issues. One of the most prominent to take place in recent years was the assembly established by the Irish parliament to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue. Jamie Grierson, Home affairs correspondent\n\nJim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, who spoke to the assembly as an expert, said he was struck by what a \u201cvery very strong result\u201d the questions produced. \u201cPeople are prepared to change,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] they don\u2019t see lifestyle changes in isolation from policy change and what businesses are doing. There is very strong support for the government shaping and directing the economy [towards net zero emissions].\u201d\n\nTheir opinions carry no legal weight or official recognition, but the organisers said the assembly members\u2019 views were significant because \u201cthere is no other group that is at once a representative sample of the UK population, and well-acquainted with the sorts of measures required to reach net zero\u201d. The assembly met for three weekends in Birmingham early this year, before lockdown, and since then attended three online meetings in April and May.\n\nCitizens\u2019 assemblies have been used in other countries to help guide government decisions on tricky or controversial policy issues, most notably on the 2018 referendum on abortion in Ireland.\n\nTheir full findings will be released in September, but an interim report on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis is being published on Tuesday because the government is engaged in working out its economic response to the pandemic. The interim findings will also figure in a report by the committee on climate change this Thursday, which does carry statutory weight, as the government must make a formal response.\n\nCampaigners called on ministers to take note, and plan for a green recovery that would be \u201cmind-blowingly popular\u201d. Muna Suleiman, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to push the reset button on our carbon-guzzling and dysfunctional economic system, and prioritise the health and wellbeing of our planet and its people.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the government has been given an overwhelming mandate for action from the informed public,\u201d said Rosie Rogers of Greenpeace. \u201c[If ministers fail to act] it will be glaringly obvious who they\u2019ve been listening to behind the scenes.\u201d",

        "article": "People do not want to go back to the way things were, but the good intentions could fade without the right leadership\n\nBritain is crying out for a better normal. Communities across the country are emerging from lockdown with a new sense of what is possible and what is necessary \u2013 and the answers to both go a lot further than Westminster\u2019s efforts to drive the country back to business as usual.\n\nThat was the overriding impression from a two-week reporting trip around Britain, asking people in different regions how they view recovery and whether there is an appetite for more fundamental change.\n\nThe answer, overwhelmingly, was that we cannot just go back to the way things were, that there are elements brought out by lockdown that should continue, and that more needs to be done to prepare the country for the economic, mental health and climate crises to come.\n\nDuring the two-week trip, the Guardian reported on some of the communities worst affected by Covid-19, most vulnerable to economic shocks, and most interested in transition to a healthier, cleaner and fairer way of life. I visited Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Hartlepool, Aberdeen, Machynlleth, Fishguard and Bristol.\n\nTravelling by campervan, which doubled as a mobile office, hotel, restaurant and toilet, I interviewed more than 50 people, mostly in parks, hotels and shopping centres but also in a graveyard, and over phone and video calls. The Guardian also collaborated with YouGov-Cambridge Centre and Jesus College Intellectual Forum at Cambridge University to conduct a survey of more than 1,600 people.\n\nThe poll, carried out at the height of lockdown in May, found that the British public believed the pandemic had been bad for mental health (41% negative, 40% neutral and 16% positive) and bad for individual finances (31% worse off, 47% the same and 18% better off), but good for family relations (40% positive, 46% neutral and 11% negative).\n\nThey also said it had been excellent for air quality (66% positive, 20% neutral and 3% negative) and the overall health of the planet (75% positive, 12% neutral, 4% negative).\n\nQuick guide Five ideas for a better normal Show Hide Improve air quality by promoting home working, cycling, walking and public transport , all of which reduce pollution. Those who do need a car should be encouraged to use electric vehicles. State support for clean car manufacturing could create and protect jobs, especially in the West Midlands. Tackle inequality and unemployment with investments in energy efficient homes and low-carbon industry. To meet the UK\u2019s net zero target, 2,000 home boilers a day will need to be converted to hydrogen or other clean energies. Front-loading this work would create a huge number of jobs. Thousands more could be created in carbon capture and storage projects, such as that planned for the north-east. Accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Oil and gas companies have shed thousands of jobs during lockdown. Meanwhile, wind and solar plants have proved they can provide cheap, stable electricity. Promoting a more rapid - and just - transition, with retraining and greater investment in clean power will modernise the UK economy, cut emissions and help workforces adapt, especially in places like Aberdeen that can no longer rely on North Sea oil. Diversify food production so the UK is more resilient to future shocks in the global supply system. Farmers should be supported to rebalance production away from meat for export and towards more fruit and vegetables for local markets, as well as stewardship of shared natural services like clean water, rich peatland and forests for flood protection. That will make the country more self-sufficient, cut emissions and reduce food miles, as rural areas in Fishguard and Machynlleth are finding. Empower local communities. The upsurge of neighbourhood support groups has been one of the big positives from lockdown and could be a building block for a more inclusive society. If mutual aid can be extended to mutual ownership - with city and national government support - more people would have a stake in protecting and nurturing common assets like green spaces and rivers, but also potentially wind turbines or solar plants, as a working class neighbourhood in Bristol is trying to do.\n\nThe journey revealed how quickly local communities had adapted to ease the worst impacts of lockdown and build on the benefits. Social centres, community-owned pubs, food banks, green groups and art cooperatives repurposed themselves within days to distribute food and medicine, set up online counselling and cooking classes, and provide emergency financial support \u2013 sometimes in the form of \u00a350 in an envelope \u2013 for the many zero-hours contract workers who were suddenly unemployed but not immediately able to claim benefits.\n\n\u201cThe virus gave us permission to be kind again,\u201d said Sacha Bedding, manager of the Annexe community centre in Hartlepool. \u201cWe should celebrate the way communities have responded. Millions did a good thing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Community activist Sacha Bedding. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nWhile communities have shown speed and strength, the national government has proved slow and inept. The UK has so badly botched its response that the country is now recording more weekly deaths than the 27 EU nations combined. Britain\u2019s economy has suffered more than that of any country in the G7.\n\nHarder to calculate is the emotional wellbeing of the nation, but the survey found higher levels of stress and many interviewees expressed concern about a looming wave of mental health problems.\n\nIn an analysis of possible post-Covid-19 scenarios drawn up by the Long Crisis Network, the most compelling is a weakening of national and city institutions as they struggle to cope with a wave of crises that resemble \u201cthe latter, more frenetic stages of Tetris\u201d. Alternatively, it predicts that these national and municipal institutions will act as a platform for ideas that emerge from communities and online.\n\n\u201cLife becomes more local. The virtual is the new norm as physical travel seems daunting,\u201d envisages the study. \u201cCovid mutual aid networks evolve into essential assets in most places, balancing flexibility and informality, even providing hardship funds and peer-to-peer loans.\u201d In many places, this is already happening.\n\nThe reporting trip revealed how low-income Hartlepool has been less affected economically than affluent, globalised Aberdeen, where the collapse of oil prices prompted North Sea drilling companies to sack rig workers and engineers.\n\nIn Hartlepool, a third of families were workless even before the pandemic struck. This meant the town had less to lose and its community support networks were already hardened by previous crises. \u201cInstead of levelling up, we could see a levelling down,\u201d Bedding warned. \u201cHartlepool could be the future for other towns.\u201d Avoiding that means anticipating the next crisis rather than reacting only to the last.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everyday life in Hartlepool, County Durham. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nAfter the financial crisis of 2008, the government put the onus for recovery on individuals by slashing public spending and encouraging UK consumers to splurge. That is less of an option now. Many people are still wary of entering shops and other public spaces. Despite the easing of the lockdown, most shopping centres were eerily empty. Angela Arnold, a coffee shop owner, said mindsets had shifted during lockdown. \u201cI think it has changed people\u2019s perceptions of shopping. We don\u2019t just buy what we want. We feel like we have to justify it is what we need.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Angela Arnold and her brother Trevor Sherwood, co-owners of Lilyanne\u2019s coffee bar in Hartlepool. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nThe survey found that many people plan to improve themselves. Compared with life before the pandemic, the survey found people expect to keep in better touch with family and friends (48% more, 43% same, 6% less), visit parks (52% more, 38% same, 7% less), do physical exercise (50% more, 41% no change, 6% less), socialise with neighbours (33% more, 56% no change, 8% less) and eat healthily (38% more, 55% no change, 3% less). Respondents also said they aspired to drink less alcohol, produce less household rubbish and recycle more.\n\nThere is also hope that lockdown will be good for the environment: 47% of people think it will be positive, 29% expect no change, and only 10% feel it will make things worse.\n\nBut these good intentions could fade quickly without a strong sign from the government that the UK will not drift back to environmentally destructive economic habits. For all the prime minister\u2019s talk of a \u201cfairer, greener recovery\u201d, he seems more interested in pouring concrete, laying tarmac and encouraging consumption.\n\nDuring the trip, mayors and academics said more could be gained if the state opened its wallet with investments to modernise the economy, create jobs and cut emissions.\n\nCar manufacturers need a jumpstart to switch production to electric vehicles, or they will be left behind by foreign competitors. In the north-east, plans for Europe\u2019s biggest carbon capture and storage plant will give work to thousands and help cut emissions. In Aberdeen, wind turbine makers and hydrogen gas developers are creating jobs while oil companies are shedding workers.\n\nAcross the country, the biggest employment boost could come from converting home heating systems. Although this may be less politically attractive to the prime minister than building \u201cBoris hospitals\u201d, it will do more to end fuel poverty and create jobs. The nation needs to convert 2,000 home gas boilers every day until 2050 to reach its legally binding net-zero carbon goal.\n\nThere are also huge gains to be had from greater self-sufficiency and diversity in energy and food. At a community level, this is already happening. In Wales, the \u201cland army\u201d of volunteer workers are sharing their first harvest among the needy, promoting a \u201cbuy local\u201d movement, and encouraging sheep farmers to devote more of their land to fruit and vegetables to reduce the risks of shortages and price spikes from imports. In Bristol, the working-class community of Lawrence Weston has opened a lockdown support centre and plans to build its own wind turbine, which would give it a revenue stream for the next 30 years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A field of sheep is observed close to Machynlleth, North Wales. Britain Beyond Lockdown. Wales is adapting to the new rules with of engagement in the aftermath of the Covid 19 virus. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nSuch strategic planning is essential. Community leaders know the health crisis is certain to be followed by a tsunami of unemployment, bankruptcies and mental health problems, and the ever more catastrophic effects of climate breakdown. As a result, resilience has gone from being a trendy buzzword for policy wonks to a priority for survival. During the lockdown, communities have shown themselves to be nimble and creative in these regards.\n\nThis could be a building block for the future. Lucy Stone, a Dorset-based social entrepreneur who set up a community energy project in her village, believes collective local initiatives are creating a culture of \u201ccommoning\u201d \u2013 sharing ownership, risks, benefits and decision-making. \u201cYou literally give people a stake. You don\u2019t just consult them,\u201d she observed. \u201cThis approach could accelerate action on climate and address the inequalities embedded in our current fossil fuel systems.\u201d\n\nThat is a far cry from Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cbuild, build, build\u201d attempt to return to business as usual. But it could bring people together, focus more on wellbeing than profit, and make the country more resilient to future shocks. It would also represent change on the scale the public desires.",

        "article": "Communities in Bristol are devising their own solutions to problems linked with the city\u2019s role in slavery\n\nDuring lockdown, the wild grass in Bristol\u2019s Greenbank cemetery has grown higher than many of the tombstones, transforming the land above the dead into a gothic meadow. Nominally closed to the public before 4pm each day, the grounds are a popular location for joggers, strollers and dog walkers, who enter through a gap in the fence. For Zakiya Mckenzie, a local writer, this is the furthest from home she has been in three months, but she has chosen this spot for an interview because of its historic symbolism \u2013 a subject that has has come to the fore like never before in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nShe leads me down wooded slopes to a waist-high monument set in a glade, a little apart from the other tombs. It is the relocated grave of a group of Baptist people, including Fanny Coker, who was born a slave in the Caribbean island of Nevis in 1767 and died in Bristol in 1820, serving as a housemaid to one of Bristol\u2019s wealthiest plantation-owning families.\n\nSimple, secluded and shared, the stone could hardly be more different from the elaborate statue of the slave trader Edward Colston, which held pride of place in the centre of Bristol until last month, when it was pulled down by Black Lives Matter activists and thrown into the harbour.\n\nFor Mckenzie, this is part of an overdue reconsideration of the wealthy, predominantly white world\u2019s mistreatment of other people and the environment.\n\n\u201cThis is the perfect time to discuss land and history. A lot of people are upset that Colston\u2019s statue has been pulled down. We must discuss why,\u201d she says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The poet Zakiya Mckenzie at the memorial to the enslaved people who died in a fire at a Baptist church in Bristol and were denied a proper burial until 1926. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian\n\nSince 2016, Mckenzie has been working as part of the Black and Green Ambassador project that aims to address the exclusion of black, working class and immigrant communities from the largely white, middle class environmental movement.\n\nShe has focused on nature walks, field trips and discussions on the Ujima community radio station, while also encouraging green groups to make more space and time for different voices and a greater understanding of the global, structural cause of the climate, nature, health and inequality crises.\n\nIn the wake of the lockdown there is strong public support for a fundamental rethink. A substantial majority want big or moderate changes in the way the economy is run, while only 6% are opposed to change, according to a recent YouGov survey. Prominent figures from business, unions, the bureaucracy and the church have echoed the need for a \u201cfairer and greener\u201d rebuilding.\n\nWhile there is scant recognition of the need for environmental justice at the national government level, communities have proved more adept at linking global environmental concerns with local social inequalities.\n\nBristol has been at the centre of both the problem and the search for solutions. In the early 18th century, this city in south-west England profited from the slave trade and monoculture plantations more than anywhere else in the UK. Over centuries, the city\u2019s merchants financed more than 2,000 voyages on a triangular trade route: first taking British manufactured goods to Africa, then cramming the hold with slaves for transport to plantations in the West Indies, and finally returning with sugar cane and cotton.\n\nThe human and environmental toll continues to be felt today, but Bristol is also going further than most in trying to address the consequences. This was the first major city in Europe to directly elect a black mayor, the first in the world to declare a climate emergency and the first in the UK to be named a European green capital.\n\nThere has been tension between largely white, middle class environmental activists who say the climate should come before all else, and black and working class communities who are more focused on day-to-day economic inequality. But the mayor, Marvin Rees, says the ultimate goals are aligned.\n\n\u201cThese are not separate agendas,\u201d he said. \u201cThe climate is an issue of social justice. People hit first and hardest by the destruction of the planet look like me and my father.\u201d\n\nBristol has promised to go carbon neutral by 2030, which is the most ambitious target of any city in the country and 20 years ahead of the national government, but even before the pandemic it was off-track, and the lockdown has punched an \u00a380m hole in the city\u2019s revenues from council tax and business rates. Rees said he would be looking for savings from climate interventions and flood defences rather than frontline services, such as care homes and refuse collection.\n\nThis triage of today\u2019s crisis over tomorrow\u2019s was reluctant. Rees wants the central government to intervene by front-loading planned investments in retrofitting homes, public transport and decarbonising the energy system. The focus, he said, should be on creating jobs in the transition to clean energy. \u201cThere is no doubt the next shock will be the climate shock. We can\u2019t get away from that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to remember the green economy is also about housing quality, not just wind farms.\u201d\n\nNobody needs to tell that to the working class community of Lawrence Weston. This post-war housing estate in north-west Bristol is one of the lowest income neighbourhoods in the UK, but it has also gone further than most in marrying local social concerns with climate strategy. This is thanks to a strong community spirit, a supportive council and a nimbleness in adapting to crises.\n\nDuring the depths of austerity in 2012, the city threatened to close the local youth centre, so a group of residents took over the building and made it a community hub for debt advice, mental health counselling, veterinary advice, craft workshops and classes for zumba and kickboxing. During lockdown, they have repurposed the building once again as a distribution hub for food parcels and prescription deliveries.\n\nMark Pepper, a lifelong resident who works full-time as the project development manager of Ambition Lawrence Weston, said the lockdown had strengthened the community and made people more determined to push ahead with infrastructure projects that could make them more resilient to future shocks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Pepper, of Ambition Lawrence Weston, near the site where they plan to build a wind turbine for the community. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian\n\nHe says residents realise they can make money and save the planet at the same time. Helped by donors, including a lottery-funded Big Local budget and a 50% share in the profits of a solar power plant, they have hired specialist consultants to help them draw up an ambitious community action plan to build affordable, environmentally friendly housing, install new charging points for electric cars and improve cycle access.\n\nResidents \u2013 70% of whom say they struggle to pay heating and electricity bills \u2013 can use a mobile phone app that employs thermal imaging to spot weaknesses in the energy efficiency of their homes. Local traders then fix the draughty windows and insulate the lofts, but only charge a fee to those who can afford it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot on climate, but only by accident,\u201d Pepper says. \u201cWe used to think the climate was a middle class problem, that had nothing to do with us because we have low car ownership and few people take foreign holidays. Our residents have more pressing worries like paying the rent, heating their homes and buying enough food for their families.\u201d\n\nBut they now see it as a way of investing in the future. Later this month, Pepper \u2013 who left school with no qualifications \u2013 is expecting a response to the community\u2019s proposal to build a \u00a35.4m wind turbine. The planned 4.5MW tower would be erected 3km from Lawrence Weston and generate enough electricity to power 3,850 homes and generate an income for the community of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3400,000 a year depending on borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cWe want an economic return as well as a reduced carbon footprint. We\u2019ll use the cash for a training academy so that residents can get good jobs in renewable technology, energy efficiency and passive building construction,\u201d Pepper says.\n\nFor him, this is a question of independence. \u201cWe hope that after Covid there is more recognition for grass-roots social infrastructure that enables us to help ourselves more,\u201d he said.\n\nEncouraging more collective ownership may seem a thousand miles away from the government\u2019s policies, but many believe this is key to engaging a wider community to reduce emissions, care for nature, and address prejudice and inequality. Other countries have demonstrated that this coming together of people, energy and land does not need to be a distant utopia.\n\nIn Germany, nearly half of renewable energy is cooperatively owned, in France more than half the agriculture market is farmer cooperative owned, compared with 6% in the UK, and in the global south, communal forest management is more effective at carbon sequestration than government-run programmes.\n\nThe poet Mckenzie is optimistic this crisis will open doors and strengthen communities.\n\nThe felling of the Colston statue has inspired her to start writing again, after being blocked for the first couple of months of lockdown. She is venturing out further physically and moving campaign activities online, which makes them more accessible. The Black and Green Ambassadors project has also received a grant from the national lottery to recruit three new ambassadors and a full-time administrator. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. This is our baby,\u201d Mckenzie says.\n\nShe also plans to promote the idea that well-being needs to be made more of a priority than economic growth. \u201cThe pandemic has made us realise the importance of essential workers and nature. We\u2019re all interconnected,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just go back to business as usual. That would be to the detriment of everyone.\u201d",

        "article": "The pandemic has highlighted the fragility of global supply chains and identified a need to redefine the role of food in the economy\n\nThe first post-lockdown crops of the land army have been harvested. The food \u2013 chard, spinach, lettuce and radish \u2013 is being parcelled out to the local shops, market stalls and those in need. Now the volunteer labour force has its sights on a new goal: a land-use revolution that will make UK farming more nature friendly, plant-based and resilient to future shocks.\n\nAt Machynlleth, a bucolic town on the southern fringe of Snowdonia, the recently formed Planna Fwyd! (Plant Food!) movement is encouraging sheep farmers to diversify into vegetable production as their ancestors did. Teams of volunteers have sown crops of potatoes and, once or twice a week, they now fan across the slopes to tend gooseberry bushes, peas and squash. Others distribute seed packets to local families and run online classes on how to grow plants at home.\n\n\u201cIf the whole coronavirus experience has taught us anything, it is that we should be more self-sufficient. It was terrifying seeing the empty shop shelves,\u201d said Chris Higgins, a retired academic who gets as much back as he gives from the voluntary work. \u201cIt\u2019s very enriching. Growing and cooking food and working together is a great way of engaging with the local community and nature at the same time.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Higgins, part of a small collective of volunteers that plant and grow edible crops, stands in the grounds of a plant garden in Machynlleth, north Wales. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, eco-farming in rural communes was considered a fringe activity, but many of its core concepts \u2013 local distribution, diversity and eco-system management \u2013 have become mainstream concerns in the wake of a pandemic that made the public appreciate the vitality of nature and the fragility of global supply chains.\n\nFor many, the greatest upside of the crisis has been the respite for other species \u2013 deer on the beach in Hartlepool, mountain goats wandering the streets of Llandudno, more dolphins and porpoises in the harbour at Fishguard. In a nationwide YouGov-Cambridge Centre and Jesus College Intellectual Forum at Cambridge University survey, conducted in partnership with the Guardian at the peak of the lockdown, 75% of respondents felt the lockdown has been good for the environmental health of the planet. There were also strong expectations that the benefits to nature and the climate would continue after the crisis. The poll showed 47% believe the lasting impact of lockdown will be positive for the environment, 29% foresaw no change, and only 10% believed it would make things worse.\n\nAs the lockdown eases, Boris Johnson says the \u201cnation is coming out of hibernation\u201d, but unless more space is found for nature in the government\u2019s recovery plans, wildlife will once again retreat, the soil degrade and the climate destabilise.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Volunteers plant and grow edible crops on land close to Machynlleth, one of the most progressive rural communities in the UK. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nHistory shows the folly of trying to return to business as usual after a pandemic. In the 14th century, the Black Death disrupted trade, left crops unharvested and prompted devastating famines. The aristocracy attempted to regain lost revenue and authority with higher taxes and more restrictions. This created the conditions for Wat Tyler\u2019s Peasants Revolt and the Welsh war of independence led by Owain Glyndwr.\n\nToday\u2019s rebels want greater food security, lower carbon emissions and healthier commons that can provide clean water, fresh air and a stable climate for everyone. This is not just the Landworkers Alliance and Extinction Rebellion Farmers, but academics and former ministers who say it makes good business sense.\n\nMachynlleth \u2013 the first seat of government for Glyndwr in the 15th century \u2013 is today among the most progressive rural communities in the UK. The landscape is recognised by UNESCO as a globally important biosphere, it is the site of the Centre of Alternative Technology, and its council was the first in Wales to declare a climate emergency.\n\nThe small population of 2,200 people is also home to a disproportionate number of influential thinkers, including Jane Powell, the coordinator of the Wales Food Manifesto. The writer and activist said Covid-19 had instigated a clamour for food democracy. \u201cIt has mobilised people. There is a huge uprising of people volunteering to distribute or grow food. They\u2019ve seen the fragility of global supply chains. I think it has given people a sense of \u2018gosh, it\u2019s up to us\u2019. We\u2019d like to be better prepared next time. We need more control and knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn Wales \u2013 as elsewhere in the UK \u2013 the pandemic exposed the risks of excessively specialising in sheep and cattle for export. This was already a concern due to Brexit, which will end subsidies and reduce markets, and a broader consumer trend to eat less meat. Lockdown brought a sudden dearth of vegetables and a glut of lamb. Shocked consumers are calling for a more reliable local supply. Welsh hill farmers are looking for new revenue streams either by planting crops or charging for ecosystem services, such as flood control, wildlife habitat and peatlands that absorb carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cThis pandemic gives us the permission to think differently,\u201d says former Welsh environment minister Jane Davidson. \u201cThe UK government, particularly in a post-Brexit scenario, has the biggest opportunity since 1974 to redefine the role of food in the economy and to create the stewards of the land to ensure the country is resilient.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ducks at Daniel Colbourne and Rachel Stevens\u2019 duck farm, close to Fishguard, West Wales. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nDavidson is the woman behind one of the world\u2019s most progressive pieces of legislation: the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, which was passed by the Welsh Assembly in 2015. This obliges policymakers to think long term and take environmental limits into account. She says food is at the heart of this approach. \u201cWe are realising what is important. It is not finance, it is food producers, delivery truck drivers and shop workers. States should create new opportunities around food production. That is the kind of decent work that sustains people during a crisis.\u201d\n\nThe 10-acre smallholder has just written a book on the subject, and says the focus should not be \u201crewilding\u201d, but on reasserting the lost human role in nature. She says the UK should set up land commissions in the four home nations and use subsidies to encourage diversity rather than monocultures. This is likely to mean less sheep for export and more horticulture for the domestic market. Currently, only 2% of the fruit and vegetables eaten in Wales are grown locally.\n\nThere is money to be made. Helen and Keith Lessiter run the vegetable, fruit and flower stalls at the farmers market in the Fishguard town hall. They have seen a surge in demand for seeds and plants. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been so busy in 10 years,\u201d says Helen. \u201cEverybody wants to do their own growing. That is great. The more local production the better.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest English and Chinese produce for sale at farmer and greengrocer Keith Lessiter\u2019s stall in Fishguard Market, Fishguard, Wales. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nThe couple rent a cottage on 100 acres of land. When they started out, Helen was advised to have a gimmick that would set her apart from other traders so she wears a black bowler hat adorned with a pink ribbon and a garland of plastic flowers. Since the start of lockdown, such contrivances are unnecessary. She estimates business on her stall is up 70%, while sales of her plants through a local hardware store are 10 times higher than last year. \u201cI hope this experience has made people appreciate what goes into food production. It has been classed as menial work for so long. Now people can see that it is not just a case of stick it in the ground and wait.\u201d\n\nFarmers won kudos by donating to community support groups that kept people fed at a time of lay-offs and delayed social benefits that forced more than 6 million people to cut portions or skip meals. Rachel Stevens and Daniel Colborne, a middle-aged couple from Worcester, left jobs in engineering and factories to raise ducks, plant crops and create a woodland on a four-acre plot of land just outside Fishguard. At the start of lockdown, they lost sales from luxury hotels and instead donated their eggs to the \u201ccommunity fridge\u201d, which distributes food to more than 300 residents. This helped them later benefit from the burgeoning \u201cbuy local\u201d movement. \u201cIt has been a hard slog, but this crisis might help us in the long run. People have got a taste for what we have to offer.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Helen Lessiter at her flower and plant stall on Fishguard Market, Wales.

Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nSuch dynamism and idealism at the local level could morph into frustration, resentment and protectionism if the UK government\u2019s Covid-19 recovery plans involve rural funding cuts and a rushed trade deal with the US, which would flood supermarkets with cheap, low-quality imports.\n\nThis is the fear of Sam Robinson, a shepherd, who lives just outside Machnylleth. He recently planted half an acre of potatoes for the first time, which he sees as part of a welcome return to mixed farming. \u201cI am a defender of lamb and beef, but it is great to see a return of diversity,\u201d he said. He also works on woodland creation projects for farmers. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a huge surge of interest,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we achieve depends on support. So far, the Welsh government has made this a priority, which means funding is available.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Colbourne tending to the field in the land close to Fishguard, West Wales where he and Rachel Stevens have just started a duck farm. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nA change in land use is essential for the UK to get back on track towards its climate goals. Returning peatland, bogs and other habitats to their natural state could absorb as much as a third of the UK\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Wildlife Trust.\n\nClive Faulkner, of the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, said the region had proved it is possible to reskill farmers as environmental stewards and restore the land. \u201cTwenty years ago people thought we were kooky, but now many are following.\u201d\n\nHe is now working on the holy grail of agrarian reform: how to value ecosystem services, find a buyer and establish a mechanism for payment. That had seemed within reach until Covid-19. Faulkner was given a grant from the Welsh government to set up pilot schemes. UK officials had discussed eco-system service payments as part of the agriculture bill, which is currently going through parliament.\n\nThe fate of these long-term plans has been thrown up in the air by the pandemic and government urgency to jump-start the economy with a building boom.\n\nFaulkner urged the government not to neglect the countryside. \u201cI worry about who will support the farming community,\u201d he said. \u201cCovid-19 is an amazing catastrophe, but it is not as systematic a threat as our broken relationship with the landscape.\u201d",

        "article": "Like many young people in Aberdeen, Mike Scotland dreamed of a well-paid job on a rig in the North Sea, in the oil and gas field that has made his home town a boom town for most of the past 40 years.\n\nIn February the 28-year-old landed the position he had wanted with Shell, and he was due to take a helicopter to the Shearwater platform in July once he had completed training.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever been as excited about anything in my life,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAll I ever wanted was to land a health and safety role on a rig. I really wanted to make a difference.\u201d\n\nThen Covid-19 struck, oil prices crashed, new projects were cancelled and Scotland was laid off. He is now working as a team member at the KFC restaurant in the Haudagain retail park, where he earns the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cI earn in a week what I would have made in a day on the rig, but I can support my family and that is the main thing,\u201d said Scotland, whose fiancee is expecting their second child in July. \u201cI appreciate I have a job. Many don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike Scotland was due to fly to an oil rig in July, but now works at a KFC in Aberdeen. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nIntergenerational divide\n\nSince the start of the crisis, thousands of workers have been laid off in Aberdeen, which is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Europe. The town was already struggling to recover from a sharp fall in crude prices five years ago, as well as increasing social pressure to rein back on fossil fuels that are destabilising the climate.\n\nThe pandemic looks likely to accelerate the shift towards renewable energy, but while this raises hopes for a greener future, it also throws up huge concerns about intergenerational injustice. Without government intervention, the young look set to take a double hit from the post-lockdown economic downturn and the energy transition.\n\nWill the coronavirus kill the oil industry and help save the climate? Read more\n\nNo age group is immune to the shift, but those closer to retirement are more likely to have a nest egg saved up from the golden era of North Sea oil.\n\nTimothy Robinson, 62, a petroleum geologist, has decided to retire early as a result of the coronavirus downturn, which he believes is likely to choke the revival of the oil industry in Aberdeen\n\n\u201cI have almost 40 years of experience in energy and it is currently undergoing by far the most fundamental changes I have ever seen. The only growth areas I can see for it in Aberdeen are decommissioning old rigs and offshore wind energy,\u201d he said. \u201cI would advise anyone who [is] entering the industry to focus on developing experience and expertise in areas that are CO 2 -neutral, because that is the future.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Timothy Robinson is a geologist who is retiring early as a result of the coronavirus downturn. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nIn terms of the economic fallout from Covid-19, Aberdeen is likely to be among the worst-affected cities in Britain. This is partly because it has so much to lose. The city has grown affluent thanks to its offshore expertise, which is in demand around the world. The population here are highly globalised, and many technicians and consultants fly off for several months of the year to do lucrative contract work on oil fields in Africa, South America or Asia.\n\nIt\u2019s a domino effect here as \u2018Aber-dream\u2019 turns to \u2018Aber-nightmare\u2019 Nicola Gardiner\n\nBut a Guardian callout to readers about the impact of coronavirus revealed a huge number of job losses that some say are barely covered in the media.\n\nNicola Gardiner, an Aberdeen resident whose husband works in the oil and gas industry, explained how her once-prosperous home city had been affected. Chatting on wicker chairs in the spacious garden outside her traditional granite house, she said house prices had slumped, people were stuck in negative equity and there were no jobs. Efforts to diversify the local economy by attracting more tourists have been hit by delays to the \u00a3350m harbour development. Restaurants and hotels are empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a domino effect here as \u2018Aber-dream\u2019 turns to \u2018Aber-nightmare\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are bleak times ahead. That\u2019s what happens when an industry is dying and a pandemic arrives.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nicola Gardiner, an Aberdeen resident whose husband works in the oil and gas industry. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nA just transition\n\nOn the seafront, seagulls circle noisily over roads and beaches that are considerably emptier than those along the coastline south of the border. A helicopter buzzes overhead, taking workers out to oil and gas platforms in the North Sea, but the number of such flights is far lower than six months ago.\n\nAndrew Duncan (not his real name) used to be a frequent passenger because he specialises in maintenance of drilling equipment. Last week he was laid off after more than five years\u2019 employment at a major oil service company.\n\nHe believes the Covid-19 crisis is being used by some firms as an excuse to accelerate restructuring plans. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely gutted. They went about it in an underhand, sneaky way,\u201d he said. \u201cI was treated as if I was just another asset, like a piece of equipment.\u201d\n\nHe asked for his name to be changed because a public complaint could undermine his chances of getting a new job in the close-knit oil town, but he is seething at his experience.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Currently redundant moored oil rigs and platforms at Invergordon. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nHe is worried about how he can provide for his wife and child. \u201cThis is just the beginning. The oil industry faces a perfect storm of lockdown, low prices and climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nNow he is applying for jobs in the wind turbine industry and oil rig decommissioning. \u201cThat is the future,\u201d he said. He is encouraged by the Scottish government\u2019s plans to support workers left adrift in the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. \u201cIf they could help me with training as a wind turbine technician, that would give me an extra chance.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish government has gone further than the rest of the UK in preparing its economy and workforce for a shift to renewables. Rachel McEwen is part of the Just Transition commission, which has been advising the Scottish government on ways to shift from high-carbon to low-carbon industry with minimum social disruption. \u201cThe opportunities for injustice are endless. We must think where bad things will happen and get ahead of them,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is also chief sustainability officer in one of Scotland\u2019s leading companies, SSE, which last month announced a \u00a33bn investment in a new windfarm off the Angus coast, just south of Aberdeen. The 1,075MW facility will be the country\u2019s biggest ever privately funded project.\n\nMcEwen said the numbers would mean little unless there was a positive social impact. \u201cCompanies like us have pinned our whole being on finding profitable solutions to climate change. If that transition is unfair, you delegitimise it. So we have an interest in ensuring it is done in a thoughtful and just way.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Balmedie beach at sunrise. Photograph: Dan Tucker/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe potential for wind energy is evident at the Balmedie sand dunes, a short drive outside town. Gusts off the North Sea billow through the marram grass, allow kite-surfers to soar above the breakers and spin the giant turbine blades of a windfarm that sits a short distance away from the coastline. Locals joke that these giant structures were built as close as possible to the Trump golf course to infuriate the US president. But they are part of a broader trend. Aberdeenshire is said to be the largest windfarm in Europe in terms of the number of on- and offshore turbines. This is a major reason why wind is now the cheapest form of energy in the UK and has provided a substantial portion of our electricity during lockdown.\n\n\u2018Expect the worst and hope for the best\u2019\n\nColette Cohen, the chief executiveof the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, is optimistic there will be more support for energy transition in Scotland.\n\n\u201cFrom industry perspective and from government connections, I would say the only recovery is a green recovery. A lot of people have seen a better world and want a change,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. It\u2019s an amazing time to be involved in energy and technology.\u201d\n\nAmong the likely future developments are more offshore wind in the West Shetlands and the UK\u2019s first hydrogen plant, which is expected within two years.\n\nBut she warned there was likely to be a dip for between 18 months to three years, as the investment shifted direction. \u201cThat is the difficult time. That\u2019s the worry. It is hard to see how we will navigate that effectively.\u201d\n\nOne element will be managing a generational shift: as boom-era oil workers retire and old rigs are decommissioned, opportunities for the young may be hard to find. Coronavirus has made that challenge even harder because it has shut down the service sector.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The sun rises by a redundant oil platform moored off Kirkcaldy. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nThis week Scotland\u2019s advisory group of economic recovery recommended that the government provide a two-year job lifeline and training scheme for young people as part of \u00a36bn in stimulus spending. \u201cIf we don\u2019t intervene radically to transform our economy, inequalities will drastically widen, with long-term scarring for communities across the country and for our young people in particular,\u201d said the chair of the group, Benny Higgins.\n\nIt is a sensible step in keeping with Scotland\u2019s more cautious \u2013 and successful \u2013 approach to dealing with the virus itself. The country, which continues with tighter lockdown restrictions than England, has fewer cases relative to its population and a faster falling rate of infections.\n\nThis prudent approach of acknowledging risk and alleviating adversity may explain why even the worst-affected workers find reasons for hope. Mike Scotland said he was throwing himself full-hearted into his new job at KFC, as well as continuing work on the mental health and environmental charities he founded.\n\n\u201cI get it when people say they are having a bad time, but that is not an excuse to give up. I am looking at this as a life lesson, a step outside my comfort zone,\u201d he said. In the long run, he said, he believed his generation would get more opportunities because they were more familiar with technology and more open to new ideas than those who had come before them.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of people who want to change and are ready to change. But others who are not ready. I guess Covid could speed it up. People have had more time to be at home and to think,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to expect the worst and hope for the best.\u201d",

Our job is to dissuade them from entering our maritime domain.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian recently joined the Peruvian coastguard on a four-day patrol into international waters which came amid growing tension over the presence of the huge Chinese fleet off the coast of South America \u2013 some of the richest fishing grounds in the world.\n\n'They just pull up everything!' Chinese fleet raises fears for Gal\u00e1pagos sea life Read more\n\nMore than 250 Chinese ships were first detected in July as they skirted territorial waters off the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, stirring outrage in Ecuador and raising global concern about the practices of the world\u2019s largest distant-water fishing fleet.\n\nHawkeye 360, a radio frequency data analytics firm, reported that boats were \u201cgoing dark\u201d by switching off their AIS satellite tracking and entering the islands\u2019 exclusive economic zone.\n\n\u201cWe found multiple examples of maritime radio frequency activity that is within the Gal\u00e1pagos exclusive economic zone adjacent to the Chinese fleet,\u201d said HawkEye 360\u2019s CEO, John Serafini.\n\n\u201cThese signals don\u2019t align with any AIS tracking. Although the activity could represent legitimate vessels, at the very least it is suspicious behaviour,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hunt for Han Feng 806\n\nEarlier that day, the R\u00edo Ca\u00f1ete heaved and shuddered through the machine-grey waves as a coastguard officer read out ships\u2019 names from the radar scanner. Commander Atkins steered the cutter south-west directly towards the cluster of Chinese vessels.\n\n\u201cWe can clearly see the name of the ship Hangong Yu 303,\u201d he said into a radiotelephone, reading out its coordinates on the ship\u2019s bridge.\n\nThen it came into view: the Hangong Yu 303 was a large red oil tanker, and it was refueling a smaller squid jigger, pipes connecting the two across the waves. Atkins dispatched coastguard officers in one of the cutter\u2019s two RIBs (rigid inflatable boat) to get a closer look, but the fishing boat quickly disconnected from the tanker and headed off in the other direction.\n\nThe Chinese ships regularly refuel on the open ocean in order to extend their voyage as long as possible, said Atkins. \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal but it\u2019s considered bad practice,\u201d he added through his white Covid face mask. \u201cThey can be here for months and months, possibly changing their crews, but the boats remain here in the South Pacific.\u201d\n\nAfter more than 30 years with the coastguard, he could not hide his unease at the scale of the Chinese presence in the South Pacific, which has grown by roughly four times in nine years, according to Global Fishing Watch.\n\n\u201cThey have factory boats which process the catch and the product arrives packaged and ready to eat in China,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was one of these mother ships that Atkins wanted to find. He could see Han Feng 806, a refrigerated container ship, or reefer, on the radar to the south-west but as he turned the cutter to give chase, the factory ship steered a course further out to sea.\n\nHan Feng 806 stayed just out of reach. The following day, Atkins changed course, steering east and then north, along the the 200-nautical mile limit of Peruvian waters. The cutter\u2019s twin 800 horsepower engines powered it smoothly along with the Humboldt current which swells up from Antarctica bringing nutrient-rich cold water along the coasts of Chile and Peru.\n\nFishing armada Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Chinese squid jigger vessel at night. Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana\n\nThe current gives its name to the species of giant squid which flourishes in its waters. But there is genuine concern among local fishing associations that China\u2019s harvesting of the Humboldt squid will inevitably hurt Peru\u2019s fishery exports, of which the squid accounts for 43%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open secret that every year vessels mainly from China \u2026 come just at the edge of the 200-mile mark off Peru to extract this resource,\u201d said Cayetana Aljov\u00edn, president of Peru\u2019s National Fishing Society.\n\nWhile South American countries impose quotas on their Humboldt squid catches, there are no limits on vessels in international waters. About 800,000 tonnes of the fast-growing, highly migratory species are caught annually.\n\nOverfishing of the squid could have an impact across the eastern Pacific, said Gustavo S\u00e1nchez, a marine biologist studying the species with Japan\u2019s Hiroshima University.\n\n\u201cThese squid might have more than a single genetic population cohabiting in the eastern Pacific waters, implying that overexploitation in international waters does not only mean fewer squid for Peru but also squid less resilient to environmental change over a more extended region,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rosario Facebook Twitter Pinterest Peruvian coastguard officials from the vessel R\u00edo Ca\u00f1ete boards the Rosario and seizes illegal catch. Photograph: Dan Collyns\n\nThere was nothing on the horizon as the coastguard cutter surged forward under an overcast sky. Petrels and shearwaters skimmed the swell and occasionally flying fish launched themselves before the bow.\n\nA sperm whale spouted and then breached just two hundred metres from the ship, lifting spirits among the crew. \u201cIt\u2019s a good omen, boys,\u201d Atkins pronounced.\n\nHours passed uneventfully before an officer with binoculars spotted something on the starboard bow. Nearly 100 nautical miles from land a little white fishing boat bobbed on the ocean, so small it barely registered on the radar. Atkins set a course towards it.\n\nA mechanical arm lowered the eight-man RIB off the stern and armed coastguards climbed down to it from a rope ladder, ready to inspect the suspect craft.\n\nThe eight-metre Rosario had been drifting for two days with a broken outboard motor. All that its four-man crew \u2013 two seasoned Peruvian fishermen and two younger Venezuelans \u2013 had left was a large bunch of bananas, a bag of buns and some bottles of Gatorade.\n\nBut what shocked the coastguard officers was the Rosario\u2019s catch: hidden in nets stowed on the deck were four dead common dolphins, including one infant, and six sharks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Coastguard officials inspect illegal catch onboard the Rosario. Photograph: Dan Collyns\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Among the catch were dolphins and sharks. Photograph: Dan Collyns\n\nDespite the mask over his face, it was clear that the skipper, Juan Ramos, knew he had been caught red-handed. Catching dolphins and selling their meat is illegal in Peru, but butchered porpoises are used as shark bait or sold as a delicacy known as muchame or chancho del mar on the black market.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we caught a few dolphins but that was not my intention,\u201d Ramos, 52, said. \u201cIf the motor was in good condition I would have got them out [of the net],\u201d he insisted. But the coastguards doubted his story: someone had cut the tail fins from two of the dolphins to stop them breaking out of the net.\n\nJunior officer Nicol\u00e1s Castro asked Ramos for his permits and port departure documents, but he had none. Despite their predicament, Ramos, an old sea dog, said if they hoisted a sail they would be back in Anc\u00f3n, their port of departure, in 12 days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The skipper of the Rosario, Juan Ramos. Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana\n\n\u201cBefore, years ago, we fished there by the shore. Now look where we are! If we fished by the shore now we wouldn\u2019t catch anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThis all comes from bad globalization. It\u2019s not just the Chinese squid fishing boats, there are tuna fishing boats from other countries too, they come and break our nets.\u201d\n\nHe said small-scale fishermen could not compete. \u201cThe big problem in Peru is we don\u2019t have the technology. But [the foreign fleets] have factory ships, they can get anywhere and catch tonnes and tonnes [of fish] and take it away, processed.\u201d\n\nMatt Bjerregaard, a specialist in marine biodiversity and fisheries, said climate change is forcing artisanal fishermen to follow the fish into deeper water, further from shore.\n\nPlay Video 1:13 Chinese fleet vessels illuminate sea near Gal\u00e1pagos to attract squid to the surface \u2013 video\n\nBut large foreign fishing fleets are also to blame, he said, forcing fishermen \u201cto search for new fishing areas, take longer to find their catch and, in turn, this has a negative impact on their livelihoods\u201d.\n\nDespite the seizure, the boat\u2019s net was still cast \u2013 and some 50 metres away a sea lion struggled to free itself. Castro jumped on to the RIB clasping a kitchen knife and motored towards the stricken animal which thrashed wildly, entangling itself more.\n\n\u201cCome on, come on, you\u2019ll be free soon,\u201d said Castro, leaning over the bow to cut the green mesh as the sea lion bit furiously at a yellow float. Castro struggled for 20 minutes until finally the net could be hauled over the animal\u2019s head and it disappeared with a splash.\n\nPlay Video 0:51 Footage shows Chinese fleet vessels transferring cargo in seas near Gal\u00e1pagos \u2013 video\n\n\u201cGo, go, be free, be free!\u201d shouted Castro, brimming with emotion and trembling from the physical effort. \u201cHow beautiful, damn it! I\u2019m thrilled I was able to free it.\u201d\n\nIt was an emotional end to the encounter.\n\nThe fishermen and their illegal catch were taken back to the R\u00edo Ca\u00f1ete to be taken to the harbour master\u2019s office in port and probably fined; their catch would be examined by experts from the fishing ministry. The Rosario and its broken motor was left adrift on the ocean.\n\nMeanwhile, the controversial Chinese fleet continued to move south, prompting Chile to announce that its navy would monitor its movements.\n\n\u201cWhat began as an arrest for an illegal act became a search and rescue operation,\u201d said Atkins \u2013 pleased the mission had a satisfactory ending, but perhaps frustrated that he had to be content with the small fry while the big fish got away.",

        "article": "Researchers say Black infants may be more at risk while about 80% of homes had detectable levels of lead in tap water\n\nSign up for the Guardian\u2019s Green Light newsletter.\n\nNot long after Peter and Erica Finin moved from Michigan to Pittsburgh, they had the tap water in their new home tested for lead. It was 2017, and \u201cthe whole [lead] situation in Flint was very much in the news\u201d, Peter says. They\u2019d been thinking about starting a family, and wanted to be safe.\n\n'It was everywhere': how lead is poisoning America's poorest children Read more\n\nIn searching for testing options, Peter came across a program offered by Healthy Babies Bright Futures (HBBF), a non-profit alliance of scientists and child health advocacy groups, and Virginia Tech.\n\nTest results showed they had a serious lead problem, with levels high enough to potentially harm children and infants. \u201cIt made it clear we needed to get a filter,\u201d Peter says.\n\nThe Finins were one of nearly 800 families across the country included in a study, released on Tuesday, of people who had their water tested by HBBF. That included 97 households in New Orleans, and 688 from elsewhere in the country.\n\nNearly 80% of the homes outside of New Orleans had detectable levels of lead in tap water, and 40% had levels that exceeded the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended limit on lead in drinking water in schools. Perhaps most concerning, 15% had levels high enough to potentially cause at least a half-point drop in IQ in infants who are exclusively bottle-fed with formula mixed with tap water.\n\nThere\u2019s no amount of lead that\u2019s safe Jane Houlihan\n\nResults for New Orleans, in each case, were slightly worse, and were analyzed separately so the city\u2019s results wouldn\u2019t distort the national ones.\n\nLead in drinking water remains a critical issue in the US, despite attention brought by the crises in Flint and other cities, says Jane Houlihan, research director for HBBF. \u201cThere\u2019s no amount of lead that\u2019s safe,\u201d she says, adding that children \u201chave one chance to develop a healthy brain and lead erodes that chance\u201d.\n\nConsumer Reports has long been concerned about the effects of lead, particularly on children, whose brains and bodies are still developing. \u201cThis report underscores CR\u2019s previous research showing potentially harmful levels of lead in some foods and drinks babies and toddlers consume,\u201d says James E Rogers PhD, director of CR\u2019s food safety research and testing. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that the government and industry address this public health challenge immediately.\u201d\n\nA potent neurotoxin\n\nLead is ubiquitous, found in some soil, toys and ceramics, as well as some paint found in homes built before 1978, when lead paint was banned.\n\nBut drinking water is a major source. While lead pipes were outlawed in 1986, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 6-10m homes in the US still get water through water service lines that predate the ban. Lead can also come from the water supply itself, or from a home\u2019s plumbing, faucets or fixtures.\n\nIngesting even small amounts of lead over time can lead to lasting health problems because it accumulates in the body, says Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician and professor at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, who first publicized the issue of elevated blood levels in children in Flint, Michigan and was not involved in the HBBF study. Those problems include reduced IQ and academic performance, as well as attention deficit disorder and behavior problems.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha at her office in the Hurley children\u2019s center in Flint on 15 January 2016.\n\nPhotograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nBut while lead exposure can be dangerous for anyone, it\u2019s especially concerning for infants fed powdered formula that\u2019s mixed with tap water. \u201cIf the water in the home has high levels of lead, a bottle-fed baby is the family member at greatest risk because they drink a far greater volume of water per pound of body weight than older children or adults,\u201d Houlihan says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what kept me up the most at night in Flint,\u201d where breastfeeding rates were low, Hanna-Attisha says. The first four to six months, when infants consume nothing but breastmilk or formula, is key to neurodevelopmental growth, she says. \u201cLead is a potent, irreversible neurotoxin,\u201d she says. \u201cNo matter what you do, it\u2019s impossible to get rid of a child\u2019s lead exposure if it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nSince pediatricians generally don\u2019t screen infants for lead until they are one year old, and water in homes isn\u2019t necessarily tested for lead, relatively little is known about the extent of lead exposure in these first vulnerable months of life, Hanna-Attisha says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible to think we have not addressed this,\u201d she says.\n\nThe new HBBF study helps quantify that harm, as it includes a risk analysis showing how lead in these first months could cause lifetime IQ point loss for babies who consume only formula.\n\nAccording to the CDC\u2019s 2020 Breastfeeding Report Card, just 26% of babies in the US are exclusively breastfed through six months of age. That means most infants probably drink at least some formula during their first months of life. And US retail sales of powdered formula, which is usually less expensive than liquid, are estimated to be more than 10 times greater than those of liquid.\n\nWidespread contamination\n\nThe homes in the HBBF-Virginia Tech study were located in 343 cities and towns in 46 states and were built between 1840 and 2019.\n\nDespite the country-wide distribution, the study is not nationally representative. Participants all wanted to have their lead levels checked, many because they had reason to think their water could be contaminated. Still, Houlihan says, \u201cI was surprised lead was detected in so many homes.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Consumer Reports\n\nOnly 21% of the homes had no detectable amounts of lead in the water. While older homes were slightly more likely to have lead, 70% of homes built after 2000 still had some.\n\nIn nearly 40% of the homes, at least one sample exceeded 1 part per billion (ppb), the AAP\u2019s recommended limit for drinking water in schools.\n\nSpecial risks to Black infants\n\nBlack infants may be at higher risk from lead in tap water, according to HBBF\u2019s report. That\u2019s primarily because they are more likely to be formula-fed. Twenty-six per cent of Black infants are never breastfed, compared with 16% of Hispanic babies, 13% of non-Hispanic white infants and 10% of Asian babies, CDC figures show.\n\nOverall, Black children are more likely to be exposed to lead, worsening inequities from birth.\n\n\u201cBlack children have a disadvantage before they even arrive\u201d says Christin Farmer, the founder of Birthing Beautiful Communities, a group that provides childbirth and parenting education to Black women in Cleveland. She says that in that city, maps showing financially stressed and disadvantaged neighborhoods overlap with maps showing high levels of lead poisonings.\n\nQuick guide Why is there a crisis with America\u2019s water? Show Hide Issues include contaminated water, concerns that millions face obstacles to access safe, clean running water, a growing affordability crisis, plus rising alarm about the billion-dollar bottled water industry\u2019s use of public water sources at low cost. Contaminated water While drinking tap water is often the best and safest option for people in the US, some communities, often those with vulnerable or marginalized residents, face health risks from drinking water that has been affected by some form of contaminant. Lead and other metals. Possible contaminants include heavy metals like lead, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel or mercury. As the Environmental Protection Agency notes on lead: \u201c[It]... can enter drinking water when plumbing materials that contain lead corrode.\u201d Lead is harmful to health, especially for children whose neurological development can be hurt if exposed. Flint, Michigan made headlines around the world in 2015 for lead poisoning after authorities switched its water supply to the polluted River Flint.\n\nPossible contaminants include heavy metals like lead, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel or mercury.

In recent years, concerns have grown about the risks of \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, or pfas, impacting water supplies, with potentially more than 110 million Americans at risk. Some of these chemicals have been linked to cancers, liver damage, low birth weight and other health problems.

Some of the highest levels have been found in cities including Miami, Philadelphia and New Orleans. Nitrates, radionuclides. Other threats of contamination come from nitrates fertilizers with communities at risk from agricultural runoff, radionuclides which can end up in drinking water because of mining, fracking and oil drilling. There is also some growing concern about disinfection byproducts added to water to treat bacterial contamination. Water affordability The US is experiencing a growing water poverty crisis as aging infrastructure, environmental clean-ups, changing demographics and the climate emergency fuel exponential price hikes in almost every corner of the country. Exclusive analysis by the Guardian published in June 2020 of 12 US cities shows the combined price of water and sewage increased by an average of 80% between 2010 and 2018, with more than two fifths of residents in some cities living in neighbourhoods with unaffordable bills. The consequence is millions of ordinary Americans are facing rising and unaffordable bills for running water, and risk being disconnected or losing their homes if they cannot pay. Separate research has found more than two million people in the US lack running water and basic indoor plumbing. \u2013 Mark Oliver and Nina Lakhani\n\nPoorer families face greater hurdles fixing the problem, too, since homeowners are often required to pay at least part of the cost of replacing the pipes and, in many cases, don\u2019t own the properties anyway, Hanna-Attisha says.\n\nThis is the case even though getting rid of lead in water would save money in the long run, according to a report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Pew Charitable Trusts. It found that removing leaded drinking water service lines leading to the homes of children born in 2018 would protect more than 350,000 kids, and yield $2.7bn in future benefits \u2013 more than the estimated cost to replace the lines.\n\nFixing the problem\n\nHoulihan, Hanna-Attisha, and other experts say the EPA\u2019s actionable limits on lead are too high to be safe, and that the laws that regulate the use of lead are too weak for children\u2019s health.\n\nThe EPA says that, for health purposes, the lead level in drinking water should be zero. While water utilities are always required to take some steps to prevent contamination with lead and other heavy metals, they must take greater action, notably replacing lead service lines, only if 10% of samples taken from homes by a water system test above 15 ppb.\n\nWhen asked about the discrepancy between its action level and health recommendation, the EPA tells CR that the action level isn\u2019t meant to establish a safe level of lead, but is instead supposed to measure the effectiveness of corrosion control in water systems.\n\nThe EPA says its new rule provides a comprehensive approach to reducing lead in drinking water and disputes the idea that rule changes would slow lead pipe replacement. \u201cVery few water systems have conducted lead service line replacement programs,\u201d the agency says, noting that \u201cmost systems above the action level did not achieve 7% in any year,\u201d because of loopholes in the current system.\n\nWhile HBBF\u2019s findings are worrisome, Houlihan emphasizes that parents don\u2019t need to panic. And she notes that while there are no safe lead levels, the threat of lead shouldn\u2019t stop parents from feeding their babies in whatever way works best for them, whether by bottle or breastfeeding. For bottle-fed babies, there are steps parents can take to lower their children\u2019s exposure to lead in drinking water, she says.\n\nUsing a water filter is easy and affordable, and experts recommend one which is certified to remove lead.\n\nAna Cook, who lives in a Milwaukee suburb, took that step after discovering serious lead levels in her water when she was pregnant. \u201cI immediately stopped drinking the water at our house,\u201d she says, until the filter was installed.\n\nYou should also unscrew and rinse out the \u201caerator\u201d, a small screen at the end of a faucet, every few months, Hanna-Attisha says, since lead particles from corroded pipes can get trapped there.\n\nThe EPA also recommends flushing your water lines for 45 seconds before drinking water to clear out water that\u2019s been stagnant in the line, and always using cold water for drinking, cooking and baby formula since hot water can cause metals to leach from pipes.",

        "article": "The prognosis for biodiversity on Earth is grim. According to a sobering report released by the United Nations last year, 1 million land and marine species across the globe are threatened with extinction \u2013 more than at any other period in human history.\n\nAccording to a recent study, about 20% of the countries in the world risk ecosystem collapse due to the destruction of wildlife and their habitats, a result of human activity in tandem with a warming climate. The United States is the ninth most at risk.\n\nDespite this desperate outlook, the Trump administration, as part of its aggressive rollback of regulations designed to protect the environment, has lifted protections for America\u2019s animals. It has shrunk several national monuments and opened up a huge amount of federal land for oil and gas drilling, coalmining and other industrial activities \u2013 actions that conservationists warn could imperil species whose numbers are already dwindling and that are core to the health of our ecosystems.\n\nHere we look at some of the animals most at risk from Trump\u2019s rollbacks.\n\nWolverines\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A wolverine walks along rocks in Montana. Photograph: Natural Visions/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nIn 2019, the Trump administration changed the way the Endangered Species Act is applied, making it harder to protect animals. \u201cThere are many species that have been wrongly denied protection over the last several years because of this,\u201d says Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nJust last week, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced it will deny protections for the snow-loving wolverine under the Endangered Species Act. Wolverines were wiped out across most of the country by the early 1900s following unregulated trapping and poisoning campaigns. According to Hartl, they are slowly clawing their way back in some areas but there are presently fewer than 300 wolverines left in the contiguous United States.\n\nSage grouse\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A greater sage grouse fleeing the \u2018lek\u2019 \u2013 an area for courtship display \u2013 at the first sign of a predator on the McStay ranch in Craig, Colorado. Photograph: Joe Amon/Denver Post/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration plans to open up drilling on 9m acres of public land in the west, which are the habitat for thegreater sage grouse, a bird known for its mating dance and is considered an \u201cumbrella species\u201d \u2013 a bellwether for the health of many other species. Sage \u2013 grouse once numbered as high as 16 million across the western United States, but the bird\u2019s populations have plummeted in recent decades.\n\nTo accomplish its goal, the Trump administration planned to lift the protected status of the greater sage grouse in order to lease the land for oil and gas drilling, mining and other development projects. This despite the interior department\u2019s research that the impacts of oil and gas on the sage grouse are \u201cuniversally negative and typically severe\u201d.\n\nIn May, a judge put those rollbacks on hold, citing the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), a key law that requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of planned projects. But in July, Trump gutted Nepa. Conservationists worry the Trump administration will now be able to get away with removing protections for the greater sage grouse \u2013 among many other critical species.\n\nAtlantic bluefin tuna\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bluefin tuna swimming around a fishermen\u2019s net. Photograph: Pablo Bl\u00e1zquez Dom\u00ednguez/Getty Images\n\nThanks to overfishing and the continuing demand for bluefin tuna on the lucrative sushi market, the Atlantic bluefin tuna is at a fraction of its historic population.\n\nEarlier this year, the National Marine Fisheries Service passed a rule removing critical longline fishing gear restrictions in specific areas of the Gulf of Mexico during April and May, the bluefin\u2019s peak spawning time. The easing of these protections means vessels can fish for similar yellowfin tuna with longline gear and kill a certain number of bluefin as accidental \u201cbycatch\u201d.\n\nWhooping crane\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A female whooping crane hunting in a pond at the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Photograph: Wild Horizon/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nThe endangered whooping crane, the tallest bird in North America, has made an amazing comeback from the brink of extinction since 1940 when only 15 birds survived. Since then, captive breeding programs and reintroduction efforts have boosted their numbers to several hundred.\n\nBut that comeback is now threatened. Earlier this year, the Trump administration weakened critical protections in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), a 100-year-old law that protects more than 1,000 bird species, including the whooping crane.\n\nThe new stance from the federal government will essentially allow the \u201cincidental\u201d killing of birds via buildings, energy production and other developments that act as avian death traps. A federal court recently struck down the Trump administration\u2019s reinterpretation of the law. Last week, the government announced its intention to appeal.\n\n\n\nMonarch butterfly\n\nHuman development has eradicated large swaths of the monarch butterfly\u2019s native milkweed habitat. Along with severe weather, this has resulted in a 90% loss in the monarch\u2019s numbers over the last two decades. \u201cThey could be wiped out in just a few decades,\u201d Hartl says.\n\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service is currently reviewing the monarch\u2019s designation under the Endangered Species Act. A ruling is expected by December of this year.\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s changes to the Endangered Species Act threaten efforts to preserve the monarch, which many scientists view as threatened. Listing the monarch butterfly as an \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201cthreatened\u201d species could extend it protections from the soybean and corn farmers that compete for its habitat \u2013 but changes to the ESA end blanket policies protecting all \u201cthreatened\u201d species in favor of individual plans developed for each species on a case-by-case basis.\n\nBlack bears\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An American black bear looking for salmon near Ketchikan in south-east Alaska. Photograph: Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration scrapped an Obama-era ban on a series of practices that limited how hunters killed bears and other predators on Alaskan national preserves. In doing so, the administration gave the green light to practices like setting dogs on black bears and killing bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens.\n\n\u201cWhen you allow widespread hunting of carnivores, that has a huge impact on the entire ecosystem,\u201d Hartl says. The ban aimed at avoiding artificially reducing Alaska\u2019s predator populations in an effort to keep ecosystems in balance.\n\nBees\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A honey bee visits a purple cornflower blossom in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Photograph: Robert Alexander/Getty Images\n\nBees and other pollinators are vital for global food security. But they \u2013 and, in turn, our food chain \u2013 are under threat. In 2018, the Trump administration weakened regulations on pesticide use in national wildlife refuges, opening the door to increased pesticide use across 150m acres of important pollinator habitat. The decision reverses an Obama-era ban on the use of neonicotinoid, or \u201cneonic\u201d, insecticides as well as genetically engineered crops within refuges.\n\nNeonic insecticides are a leading factor in mass pollinator die-offs worldwide. A report released last year found that US agriculture is 48 times more toxic to insects like bees and other pollinators than it was 20 years ago, largely due to an increased use of neonicotinoid pesticides. What\u2019s worse, according to Hartl, is that the use of such toxic pesticides will harm not only pollinators but birds, fish and other wildlife.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whale\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A right whale feeds off the shores of Duxbury Beach, Massachusetts. Photograph: David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nIn June, Trump announced that commercial fishing will be allowed in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts marine national monument off the coast of southern New England. As a result, hundreds of marine mammals that swim in the monument, like the endangered North Atlantic right whale, will be at increased risk of entanglement in fishing gear.\n\nAfter centuries of commercial whaling, only about 500 North Atlantic right whales remain. Although the imperiled species received protected status in the 1930s, North Atlantic right whales have been slow to recover, in part due to deaths from ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement.\n\nLeatherback turtles/humpback whales\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A humpback whale. Photograph: Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images\n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration withdrew a proposed rule meant to protect whales, turtles and dolphins, including several endangered species among them, from mile-long swordfishing gill nets off the west coast. Fishermen use these nets by hanging them like walls above the seafloor and they often indiscriminately catch whatever flows into them. (Gill net fishing is banned in most of the world\u2019s high seas.)\n\nDeath and injuries from entanglement spell trouble for endangered marine creatures such as humpback whales and leatherback turtles that feed off the Pacific coast. In 2016, at least 54 humpback whales were found tangled in fishing gear off the west coast.",

The sand covered 16 farmhouses, the village and finally the laird\u2019s mansion, by which time the entire population had fled \u2013 leaving behind 5 sq miles of featureless sand.\n\nThe devastation was made worse because the storm also changed the course of the river, making it virtually impossible to discern where anything had been.\n\nLike so many \u201cnatural\u201d disasters of modern times, much of the problem was manmade.

        "article": "The global climate crisis is the emergency of our times. Amid all the fear and sadness of 2020, it remains the overwhelming long-term threat to our planet and to everyone\u2019s health and security.\n\nThat is why we promise to keep reporting on it, raising the alarm and investigating the crisis and possible solutions, until we begin to see genuine systemic change.\n\nA year ago, the Guardian made a pledge to our readers. We promised to keep speaking out about the climate emergency, despite the formidable and well-funded forces who would much rather the subject remained buried. We adopted new language to emphasise the existential nature of the situation. We pledged to deepen our environmental reporting. Our commercial teams decided to reject all advertising from fossil fuel extractors \u2013 a first among major media companies. We committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. And that was just the start.\n\nThousands of readers from 130 countries joined us as a result, paying to support open, independent, authoritative environmental journalism that pulls no punches, exposes the depth of the crisis, and challenges us to rethink every aspect of our warming world \u2013 how it can be better, more sustainable, more just and more hopeful.\n\nThat support has enabled us to maintain a relentless focus on the environment, with almost 3,000 articles over the last 12 months. We have published investigations, scientific analysis, reports on species extinction and air quality \u2013 and we have kept the voices of those affected by global heating at the heart of our reporting.\n\nIn the past year, we\u2019ve reported from the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as other climate frontlines: the Amazon, the Sahara, the wildfires of Australia and the American west. We reported from the Cop25 summit of governments (travelling there by train). We have closely covered the movements trying to bring about change, such as Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes. We dug deep into the loss of wildlife, the problems of air pollution and microplastics, and exposed the most polluting companies on the planet.\n\nWe want our supporters to know: when you fund us, this is what you are paying for.\n\nBut of course this environmental year has been unique for another reason. A succession of related crises, not least the global Covid-19 pandemic, has brought a new perspective. These crises have starkly demonstrated how so many of our global problems \u2013 public health, migration, food security, land conflict, equality, gender and race \u2013 intersect with our environmental catastrophe.\n\nFor example, many researchers now see a correlation between species-jumping viruses such as Covid-19 and humanity\u2019s deep, destructive incursion into the natural world. Links between high air pollution and increased coronavirus infection rates have also become apparent, thanks to persistent Guardian reporting. It\u2019s becoming clearer than ever that people\u2019s mass migration from the global south over the past decade has been principally caused by changing weather. And we are coming to understand, more deeply than ever, how global heating disproportionately affects communities of colour.\n\nIndependent, expert journalism can make a difference. It generates awareness of the problems \u2013 as well as the solutions. It galvanises protest and resistance, putting pressure on government and industry to make positive changes. And it promotes and encourages best practice, human ingenuity and innovation that we can all learn from. As Christiana Figueres, the UN\u2019s climate chief when the Paris deal was sealed in 2015, told our environment editor, Damian Carrington: \u201cWithout the work of the Guardian the delivery of the Paris agreement would have been far harder or perhaps even impossible \u2026 At a time when the darkness of fake news and doubt in science is everywhere, the Guardian is a point of light.\u201d\n\nBut words alone may not be enough. We feel the need to act, too. So the Guardian is also trying to set an example. Over the past year, we have renounced fossil fuel advertising. We have eliminated more than 95% of our investment exposure to fossil fuels. We have qualified as a B Corp, a certification that will hold us to high social and environmental standards.\n\nBy 2030, we will have completely eliminated two-thirds of our emissions. For the remaining third, we will remove carbon from the atmosphere by supporting the highest-quality offsetting schemes. We don\u2019t expect these changes to be easy, and we may make mistakes along the way, but we will be transparent about our progress and share everything we learn.\n\nWars have been fought over natural resources for most of human history, and our efforts to coexist with the natural world have been written about for decades, if not centuries. But the crisis before us today is something quite different, for two main reasons. First, the stakes are higher, the planet hotter than it has been for tens of thousands of years. The risk we face is nothing less than the downfall of the civilised world, perhaps in the lifetime of today\u2019s schoolchildren. Second, we can see a path forward that avoids the worst outcomes. The worldwide response to Covid-19 has demonstrated that there can be collective global action if the threat is big enough, and that humans are capable of changing our lives and lifestyles quickly, when the moment demands it.\n\nThe threat presented by the climate crisis is big enough. Help us to galvanise the action required by supporting Guardian journalism.\n\nIt\u2019s not too late.",

        "article": "Since the Guardian pledged a year ago to give the climate crisis even greater priority, we have published a piece of environmental journalism on average every three hours. Greenhouse gas emissions, heatwaves, wildfires, melting polar ice, floods, droughts, the annihilation of wildlife, air pollution \u2026 the problems grow more severe every year.\n\nOf course, 2020 has been dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, but even here the correlation with environmental destruction is clear.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Forest clearance and plantation development in PT Megakarya Jaya Raya (PT MJR) palm oil concession in Indonesia Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Greenpeace\n\nThe Covid link\n\nThe \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d \u2013 that was the warning early in the year, when we reported that many more viruses were present in wildlife and just waiting to be released by the human destruction of nature. The UN\u2019s environment chief said \u201cnature is sending us a message\u201d that our abuse of the planet had consequences.\n\nAs critical as it is to tackle the damage caused by Covid-19, the root cause \u2013 the invasion of wild places and the exploitation of wild animals \u2013 is not being addressed, experts warned in the Guardian, despite the relatively tiny amount it would cost. Without action, even worse pandemics would happen, top scientists warned.\n\nThe cascade of pandemic impacts is also hitting food supplies in vulnerable places, with the Guardian highlighting fears of the worst food crisis in 50 years and a \u201cfamine of biblical proportions\u201d. We also revealed how meat processing plants had become hotspots of Covid-19 infections among workers: \u201cEveryone\u2019s on top of you, sneezing and coughing,\u201d one person told us.\n\nWhile a temporary reduction in air pollution was a rare benefit of the pandemic, long-term exposure to dirty air appears to drive up Covid infections and deaths. The Guardian revealed the latest research, including a striking study providing compelling evidence of a link, as well as the discovery of the virus on pollution particle samples. Poor quality air might also help explain the disproportionate impact of Covid on minority ethnic communities, we revealed.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is also an opportunity, however, with trillions of dollars being deployed to fund the recovery. In-depth series in both the UK and Australia set out how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put the world on track to tackle the climate crisis, transforming energy, transport, food and even aviation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The sun rises over Lindsey oil refinery in North Lincolnshire Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nThe fossil-fuel lobby\n\nOf course, fossil fuel vested interests remain, and the Guardian exposed their lobbying for cash in the US, Australia and around the world. We also took a road trip around the UK to seek the views of ordinary people on the Covid recovery. The conclusion: few want a return to \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nThat normal would mean the relentless rise of global heating, with the brief cut in emissions during lockdown no more than a blip. Nowhere is that heating more obvious than in the oceans. In January, the Guardian\u2019s print edition led its front page with the news of a record high ocean temperature in 2019, showing the \u201cirrefutable and accelerating\u201d heating of the planet.\n\nThe danger signs kept coming, and we kept reporting them, from the temperature in the Antarctic rising above 20C for the first time on record, to deforestation in the Amazon hitting its highest level in a decade.\n\nOne of the principal duties of the Guardian is to hold power to account. Our landmark series, The Polluters, revealed the 20 fossil fuel companies whose exploitation of oil, gas and coal reserves had caused more than one-third of all carbon emissions in the modern era, as well as Google\u2019s funding of climate change deniers and the power of the car lobby.\n\nIn the US, the 100 days countdown series to the US withdrawal from the 2015 Paris agreement showed how the global climate fight could be lost if Donald Trump is re-elected and how worsening heatwaves are exacerbating systemic racial inequalities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A fire burns in a section of the Amazon rain forest on in the Candeias do Jamari region near Porto Velho, Brazil. Photograph: Victor Moriyama/Getty Images\n\nWildfires and wildlife\n\nIn Australia, the Guardian ran an agenda-setting interactive series, The Frontline, laying bare the climate emergency in the country. The starkest illustration were the devastating bushfires that raged through the summer months and were documented in The Summer of Dread and After the Bushfires projects. Amid all this, we revealed the third mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier reef in five years.\n\nIn fighting the climate crisis, the power of protest has become a mighty force in the last two years. We have championed the protesters, being at the UN in New York for Greta Thunberg\u2019s emotional condemnation of world leaders, and exploring in depth the rise of Extinction Rebellion and how it can reinvent itself for a post-pandemic world. We also revealed that a quarter of all tweets about the climate crisis came from bots that amplified denialist messages.\n\nLike the climate emergency, the annihilation of wildlife that threatens the air, water and food on which we depend has not gone away, and neither has the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the crisis. In our Age of Extinction series we examined the deadly truth behind almond milk \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s like sending bees to war\u201d \u2013 and, like all Guardian exclusives, this was followed up widely by other media.\n\nWe also revealed the $1m-a-minute farming subsidies that are ravaging the natural world and the mysterious mass die-off of hundreds of elephants in Botswana, and dug into the UK\u2019s high-speed rail project\u2019s impact on biodiversity and climate change.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man crosses a street in downtown Portland, Oregon where air quality due to smoke from wildfires was measured to be amongst the worst in the world, September 14, 2020 Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDirty air\n\nThe largest environmental cause of human disease and death in the world today is pollution, responsible for many millions of premature deaths. We have kept a sharp focus on this, revealing, for example, research linking air pollution to brain cancer for the first time.\n\nPollution takes many forms and we have reported in depth on the \u201ccancer town\u201d in the US where the risk of the disease is 50 times above the national average, and revealed that microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers, with as yet unknown effects on lung health.\n\nRivers have long suffered from pollution but we revealed the startling fact that water companies discharged raw sewage into English rivers more than 200,000 times in 2019. The only thing worse than dirty water is no water, and we exposed the scandal of millions of US citizens being unable to afford water bills.\n\nWhile hard-hitting news is at the Guardian\u2019s core, some stories need space to tell, such as our journey to Antarctica where we encountered the surprising sound of icebergs melting, and our long read on the career of the world\u2019s most revered naturalist, Sir David Attenborough. Another extraordinary tale was that of Takaya, the lone sea wolf whose spirit captured worldwide attention.\n\nvideo An Antarctic iceberg, up close\n\nA touch of hope\n\nWe also know that finding solutions is vital in tackling the environmental challenges facing the world, which is why we reported from Darfur on how a water project was helping to end the \u201cfirst climate change war\u201d and how scientists created a mutant bacterial enzyme that broke down plastic bottles for recycling in hours.\n\nIn the UK, the good news included the benefits of beavers, which now have a permanent home in Devon as well as Scotland, and plans to rewild a large patch of East Anglia and to bring back wild bison for the first time in 6,000 years.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s commitment to environmental reporting has real world impacts, but these are rarely easy to measure. So it is useful to hear from those at the top.\n\nChristiana Figueres, the UN\u2019s climate chief when the Paris deal was sealed in 2015, said: \u201cWithout the work of the Guardian the delivery of the Paris agreement would have been far harder or perhaps even impossible. Its role has continued to be essential in the years since as the situation has become more urgent on a host of issues including climate change and biodiversity. At a time when the darkness of fake news and doubt in science is everywhere, the Guardian is a point of light.\u201d\n\nBill McKibben, the leading climate writer and campaigner, said: \u201cThere is nothing in the English-language press that comes close to matching the scope and the commitment of the Guardian\u2019s coverage of climate change. At this point, the climate change fight resembles nothing so much as a war. War reporting is the place where newspapers have traditionally shined, bringing all their resources to bear. The Guardian is the only newspaper who has figured out what our time on Earth is really about.\u201d",

        "article": "Here\u2019s a sight that hasn\u2019t been seen since 1994: shares in BP priced at less than 200p. The stock, 480p at the start of this year before the Covid recession hammered the oil price, closed on Wednesday at 199.96p.\n\nEven as recently as August, a sub-\u00a32 moment seemed unlikely. That was when the new-ish chief executive, Bernard Looney, pitched to investors his plan to make BP a net zero carbon company by 2050. The rejig seemed to go down well. Despite the inevitable cut in the dividend, BP\u2019s shares were briefly steady at 300p. There was talk about the company acting just in time to save itself from oblivion.\n\nInvestments in low-carbon assets, mainly offshore wind and solar, will rise tenfold to $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) a year by 2030 under Looney\u2019s plan. Output from fossil fuels is expected to fall 40% from 2019 levels. And BP will get bigger in convenience stores attached to filling stations and \u201cmobility\u201d, meaning charging points for electric vehicles.\n\nSo why has the company\u2019s value fallen by a third since unveiling its vision? One reason \u2013 a source of relative comfort for Looney \u2013 is that all oil companies, even those without ambitions to achieve zero carbon by 2050, have continued to be clobbered as the oil price has failed to recover. ExxonMobil, which has barely budged on climate policies, has shed an astonishing $150bn of stock market value this year. BP\u2019s share price is not an outlier.\n\nBut nor can one say that Looney\u2019s greener vision has excited BP\u2019s shareholders. That worry should also concern outsiders: the company\u2019s wind and solar investments are more likely to happen at speed if they are judged to deliver safer, more stable financial returns, which is how Looney sold his reinvention plan.\n\nHe will know the scepticism is specific: since BP is a late-comer to the renewables market (after a false start in the late-1990s), why is it confident it can achieve internal rates of return of 8%-10% from wind and solar? Don\u2019t established specialists in renewables just know the territory better than a recanting oil giant?\n\nBack in August, Looney argued that BP understood the energy landscape and its trading arm was skilled in writing the long-term contracts that underpin large renewables projects. Well, maybe, but the stock market clearly wants to hear more than a loose assertion of confidence.\n\nBP will announce its third-quarter numbers next Tuesday, which is an ideal opportunity for Looney to add some credibility, if he can, to the idea that a late-arriving oil company can also be top-of-the-class in renewables. He probably didn\u2019t think BP\u2019s investors would need a pep talk so soon, but it seems they do.\n\nWilliam Hill knows that everyone hates a happy bookie\n\nBookmakers always grumble about something \u2013 it\u2019s a form of advertising. Complaints over the years include too many favourites winning at the Cheltenham festival and, because football punters tend to back teams to win, a lack of draws in the Premier League usually provokes a moan.\n\nHere\u2019s a variation on the theme: post-lockdown results \u201chave been more unpredictable than normal\u201d, says William Hill, pushing the popular theory that the absence of crowds is affecting results. \u201cWe continue to see volatile gross win margins,\u201d it adds.\n\nHold on a minute, though, surely unpredictability is helpful for a bookmaker? A healthy helping of upsets means favourites aren\u2019t winning every time, which is the traditional worry for the setters of odds. Aston Villa beating Liverpool 7-2, for example, will have wrecked a few people\u2019s accumulator bets.\n\nOn closer inspection, William Hill probably isn\u2019t complaining. It\u2019s just dressing up its comments that way because everyone hates a happy bookie. Note how the firm didn\u2019t put a number on its gross win margin in the latest trading quarter: it just used the word \u201cvolatile\u201d. Volatility, for a bookie, is fine if the average over a period comes out roughly where it normally does.\n\nOne suspects that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. It was a pain for the bookies that it took until Monday this week for the Premier League season to produce a 0-0 score line (they like those). On the other hand, six out of 10 fixtures in the latest round of matches were draws, which was splendid outcome from their point of view. There is no reason to shed tears for the bookmakers.",

        "article": "As Britain and the rest of Europe battle the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, desperate eyes turn to central bank bosses, wondering what rescue plans they have up their sleeves.\n\nThis year the Bank of England has pumped \u00a3300bn into the UK economy via its quantitative easing programme. The European Central Bank (ECB) pushed more than double that amount into the 19 eurozone countries, and the US Federal Reserve has done the same to keep credit flowing through the banking system.\n\nThese moves have prevented another financial crash, and given governments a degree of confidence that while they wrestled with the pandemic, central banks would keep cheap credit flowing.\n\nLooking forward, the signals are not of recovery, but relapse, and it is not clear that the same old central-bank magic will make much of a difference. Inflation is sinking like a stone as consumers rein in their spending again. Annual prices in the eurozone fell by 0.3% in September following a 0.2% decline in August, according to figures last week. Consumer price inflation in the UK dropped to 0.2% in August, meaning prices barely rose.\n\nNeither the Bank of England nor the ECB is anywhere near the 2% inflation level the central banks are expected to maintain, in theory.\n\nTo make matters worse, Britain\u2019s high street lenders are beginning to tighten their lending criteria and increase mortgage and credit card loan rates, making it more difficult for poor and middle-income households to access credit. Understandable though this might be from a lender\u2019s perspective, it runs counter to the Bank\u2019s plans for a return to more normal credit flows.\n\nNext on the conveyor belt of initiatives could be negative interest rates \u2013 or from the ECB\u2019s perspective, cuts in rates beyond the -0.45% it already levies.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to charge a business or consumer for depositing money, but that is what a negative rate does. It then allows a bank to lend at a negative rate, which rewards borrowers. A negative-rate mortgage means the interest bill is credited to the borrower\u2019s account rather than debited, reducing the sum borrowed over time.\n\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, has talked at length about negative rates over the past fortnight, mostly to downplay the likelihood of them ever being used \u2013 and certainly not until next year, when his officials have completed a long investigation into their impact.\n\nAs he told the House of Lords\u2019 economic affairs committee last week: \u201cIt would be a cardinal sin on our part if we said something was in the toolbox which we didn\u2019t know if it actually worked.\u201d\n\nJudging by the comments of NatWest\u2019s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, Britain\u2019s banks have done precious little work themselves to prepare for negative rates. He said there would be \u201ctechnical issues and many contractual issues\u201d, in a very downbeat assessment of cutting interest rates to below zero.\n\nBailey said there was evidence from the ECB that a negative deposit rate discouraged corporations from keeping money sitting idly in a bank account and encouraged them to invest the funds to earn a return. This is a good thing and exactly why former Bank of England policymakers Adam Posen and David Blanchflower long ago urged Threadneedle Street to adopt negative rates.\n\nBailey and Davies are understandably concerned that consumers would rather stick cash under the mattress than leave it on deposit and watch it shrink.\n\nThat is where the central bank comes in. If NatWest can channel cheap money from the Bank into high street products, it could maintain its deposit interest rates, its margins and profitability.\n\nIf Danish banks can do it \u2013 they are among the first in Europe to have offered negative-rate mortgages \u2013 so can British banks. It just takes a little willpower and planning. If they are absent at the moment, the Treasury could give lenders and the Bank a shove. The UK needs all the help it can get.\n\nWe were hooked on carbon. Covid gives us a chance to get clean\n\nThe fall in global carbon emissions since the coronavirus outbreak may appear to be one of the few silver linings from the pandemic, but even this wafer-thin glimmer looks set to fade. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated last week that carbon emissions from the energy industry had fallen by up to 7% this year, but warned in the same breath that this seemed unlikely to last.\n\nAs global economies emerge from lockdown, factories will whir back to life, the world\u2019s steel furnaces and power plants will fire up once again, and passenger planes will return to the air. The brief reprieve from rising emissions in 2020 could be followed by the greatest surge in emissions growth on record.\n\nPerhaps the most important lesson governments can learn from the current emissions lull is how deeply embedded the sources of carbon dioxide are in the systems of our everyday lives. That it has taken an unprecedented upending of society to shave 7% from the world\u2019s carbon footprint reveals the challenge ahead if we hope to eliminate carbon entirely.\n\nThe message from the IEA is clear: achieving a structural decline in global carbon emissions will require nothing less than an overthrow of the systems that dominate today if we hope to create a carbon-neutral global economy by 2050. This low-carbon coup will need to happen within the next 10 years if we hope to avert the worst of the climate crisis. But if we\u2019re smart, we will begin now, using the aftermath of the pandemic to rethink the way things were before.\n\nThe good news? The silver lining in the challenge ahead will prove far more resilient than the false hope offered by the emissions slump of 2020: this is the chance to design a society which is not only more sustainable, but fairer and more resilient, too.\n\nWetherspoons will weather this storm better than Johnson\n\nWas it only last summer that Boris Johnson and Wetherspoons\u2019 Tim Martin were seen chortling over a pint at one of the ubiquitous chain\u2019s pubs?\n\nMartin \u2013 an outspoken cheerleader for Brexit \u2013 endorsed Johnson\u2019s candidacy for prime minister. Fast forward to the midst of the pandemic and Martin has lost faith in his man, after Spoons fell to a \u00a3105m loss \u2013 the first in its history \u2013 amid government-imposed restrictions on pubs.\n\nIn a typically wide-ranging monologue at a press conference last week, he quoted Macbeth and Bob Dylan, as well as comparing himself (as a joke, he stressed) to Nelson Mandela. But the Wetherspoons founder-chairman spent most of his time lambasting the PM\u2019s handling of the pandemic.\n\nHe likened Johnson to a batsman facing the fast bowler Dennis Lillee in his pomp without wearing a cricket box. But even in these circumstances, the PM was doing a bad job, he said, \u201cjumping wildly from pillar to post\u201d depending on what pollsters said the public might like.\n\nThe notion that Johnson is more interested in appearances than substance is something Martin could hardly have been expected to predict when the pair were mugging for the cameras at that photo opportunity last year. Still, if you had to bet on who will be at the helm longer, you\u2019d back Martin every time.\n\nSpoons may have suffered a chastening and unfamiliar loss but it remains well placed to recover, with a strong balance sheet and freehold ownership of its pub estate. It has always beaten most competitors on price, something likely to stand it in good stead as the economic impact of the pandemic bites harder.\n\nMartin will no doubt be delivering another lengthy diatribe next year, perhaps quoting from Macbeth again. (\u201cI often thought, what the bloody hell is Shakespeare going on about?\u201d he said.) But apart from when its boss trips over lines by the bard, Wetherspoons is keeping it simple, and benefiting from that.",

        "article": "The meat lobby may be powerful, but is it entitled to cultural ownership of the burger? The European parliament is to vote on whether to ban terms such as veggie burger and veggie sausage, as well as \u201ccheese-like\u201d and \u201cyoghurt-style\u201d for plant-based alternatives to dairy products. The meat industry complains of \u201ccultural hijacking\u201d by vegetarian/vegan products leading to consumer confusion and proposes that \u201cnames currently used for meat products shall be reserved exclusively for products containing meat (including) steak, sausage, escalope and burger\u201d. This includes chicken and there\u2019s already a ban on plant-based products being labelled \u201cmilk\u201d. One suggestion is for plant-based sausages and burgers to be called \u201ctubes\u201d and \u201cdiscs\u201d. As in: \u201cI must remember to pick up some Linda McCartney tubes later.\u201d Yummy!\n\nThis shows how rattled the meat industry is by the popularity of vegetarian/vegan food. It fails to understand that people eschew meat products for complex reasons (animal welfare, environment, health) and are unlikely to suffer from \u201cconsumer confusion\u201d. Sure, I\u2019m a lifelong vegetarian and have an axe to grind, but still, I\u2019ve never accidentally bought meat. In 2019, the House of Lords select committee heard that fewer than 4% of people had mistakenly purchased a vegetarian product.\n\nMeat producers point out that not all meat alternatives are healthy and can be high in salt, sugar and additives. Fair point - I\u2019m all for rigorous regulations for all foodstuffs. Nor is this about vegetarians/vegans existentially hankering after food that resembles meat. All that wondering over how, even though we don\u2019t eat meat, fish or chicken, we are still conditioned to need it represented (faked) on the plate. In truth, those vegetarians/vegans who eat meat substitutes (and not all do) aren\u2019t yearning for the real thing. It\u2019s just easier sometimes to replicate classic meals with meat substitutes, to cobble together \u201cburger and chips\u201d, \u201csausage and mash\u201d or \u201cThai chicken curry\u201d. Indeed, if you take nothing else away from this column, please understand that some vegetarians/vegans are bad cooks, and lazy with it, just like many meat-eaters. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s bizarre to watch the meat industry making what amounts to a conceptual power grab. Sausages, burgers, steaks, escalopes and the like are essentially food shapes and food shorthand, all of which has been around for so long it is the property of anyone who eats, not just people who opt to eat meat.\n\nPut like this, why would anyone bother arguing about what goes into a sausage shape or a burger shape? Would anyone care to copyright the teabag (slap a ban on impertinent fruit infusions?). Whatever decision is made, dictating that certain food shapes or dishes are only made with animal flesh seems like cultural hijacking. The meat industry can keep its meat, but burgers belong to everyone.\n\nBillie Eilish turned the tables on the body-shamers\n\nBillie Eilish: \u2018generally her body is swathed in avant-garde, carefully asexual layers.\u2019\n\nPhotograph: John Locher/AP\n\nWho will weep for the body-shamers? Pop star Billie Eilish, 18, was photographed walking along a street dressed in long shorts and a top, whereas generally her body is swathed in avant-garde, carefully asexual layers.\n\nThe result? Ridicule from certain quarters. One comment was about how Eilish had developed a \u201cmid-30s wine mom body\u201d, as if this were somehow a bad thing. Eilish responded by sharing someone else\u2019s video about the importance of normalising bodies. She then seemed to brush the whole thing off, as did her amused, scornful fans, who triumphantly posted lots of photos of Eilish holding her many Grammys.\n\nThat\u2019s all fine for Eilish, but has anyone spared a thought for the legions of hardworking body-shamers? How did they feel about this? They work tirelessly to make high-profile successful young women such as Eilish feel bad about themselves, to taint their success and happiness with vicious personal criticisms and then this happens. As in, nothing happens. No pain, no tears, no hint of an eating disorder.\n\nIt must be devastating when the body-shamed point-blank refuse to crumble into ashes and instead roll their eyes, yawn a bit and flick you and all the other trolls away like insignificant insects. Sorry, guys, it looks like body-shaming just got that little bit more difficult.\n\nThe Queen unmasked as elitist? Perish the thought\n\nNo mask, ma\u2019am? Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\nShould the royal family be sending out an anti-mask message? The Queen has carried out her first public engagement outside a royal residence since lockdown, visiting the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. She was accompanied by the Duke of Cambridge. Neither wore a face mask.\n\nIt\u2019s reported that necessary precautions were taken for the DSTL visit and social distancing was strictly observed. Glad to hear it, especially as one presumes the Queen is as vulnerable as any other 94-year-old around the virus.\n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t the only issue. Donald Trump has been widely criticised for avoiding wearing masks as though they were, erm, the plague. Even after contracting coronavirus, it wasn\u2019t long before the president was back in public, unmasked, wheezing like a broken concertina trying to crank out The Star-Spangled Banner.\n\nClearly, Trump is determined to nab that crucial anti-masker/QAnon crossover vote. Back in Blighty, the royals are very high-profile public figures and whether or not they wear masks matters. If the Queen was concerned that it would be beneath her regal dignity, then this is unacceptable. The rules have to be the same for everybody or they\u2019re meaningless. Perhaps some clever cove in government \u2013 Dominic Cummings? \u2013 could explain this to the Queen?\n\nAll over the UK, regions are being placed under varying degrees of lockdown to combat the spread of the virus. The royals need to lead by example and opting out of wearing masks on public engagements isn\u2019t only irresponsible, it comes across as insensitive and elitist. I\u2019m sure the Queen and Prince William aren\u2019t anti-maskers, but what does that matter if the effect is the same?\n\n\u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

        "article": "In 2017, we published the first peer-reviewed analysis of ExxonMobil\u2019s 40-year history of climate change communications. We found that the company and its parents, Exxon and Mobil, misled the public about climate change and its severity. Central to this conclusion was the contrast between what Exxon and ExxonMobil scientists said in internal reports and scientific articles versus what Exxon, Mobil, and ExxonMobil told the public in non-peer-reviewed publications and in \u201cadvertorials\u201d \u2013 paid advertisements dressed up to look like opinion pieces \u2013 in The New York Times.\n\nNewly leaked documents, reported recently by Bloomberg News, show that ExxonMobil\u2019s climate dishonesty is even worse than we thought. While the company privately has an internal \u201cplan for surging carbon emissions\u2026by as much as the output of the entire nation of Greece,\u201d according to Bloomberg, ExxonMobil executives \u201cshield their carbon forecasts from investors.\u201d In other words, ExxonMobil drew up plans to expand fossil fuel production, internally calculated how much this would increase their carbon dioxide emissions, then failed to disclose those estimates to investors. Indeed, the company has never publicly disclosed its emissions forecasts. In response to the Bloomberg report, ExxonMobil claimed that the leaked documents were not up-to-date, but declined to provide \u201cany details on the new projections,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nExxonMobil has launched a new attack on our research, penned by ExxonMobil Vice President Vijay Swarup in the academic journal where we published our original study. In fact, ExxonMobil, in trying to dismiss our findings, has inadvertently made them stronger. They have done so in three ways, which we summarize today in a peer-reviewed rebuttal.\n\nFirst, ExxonMobil has not challenged any of our findings about the 187 documents analyzed in our original study. They do not deny that Exxon, Mobil, and ExxonMobil all had early knowledge that their products have the potential to cause dangerous global warming. Nor do they deny that Exxon, Mobil, and ExxonMobil all promoted doubt about climate science and its implications in order to delay action.\n\nSecond, ExxonMobil accused us of analyzing \u201cless than 3%\u201d of their advertorials. This is misleading: less than 4% of their advertorials concerned climate change; most were irrelevant. Nevertheless, we have expanded our research program to include advertorials of which we were originally unaware, and found that \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 \u201cthe results strengthen our original finding.\u201d\n\nThird, ExxonMobil claims that our original publication \u201cobscur[ed] the separateness\u201d of Exxon and Mobil prior to their 1999 merger. This is incorrect and misleading: when Exxon and Mobil merged, ExxonMobil inherited legal and moral responsibility for both. Moreover, as we summarize in today\u2019s rebuttal, additional work we have done in response to ExxonMobil\u2019s complaints \u201cfurther demonstrates that both Exxon and Mobil separately misled the public, and continued to do so once they merged to become ExxonMobil Corp.\u201d\n\nAll told, \u201cwe can now conclude with even greater confidence that Exxon, Mobil, and ExxonMobil Corp have all, variously, misled the public.\u201d\n\nUnable to disprove our findings, ExxonMobil\u2019s critique has resorted to quoting a non-peer-reviewed report commissioned and paid for by the company. Instead of subjecting their positions to the independent scrutiny of academic peer-review, as we (and all scientists) do, ExxonMobil found a backdoor, so that they could then claim that our work has been refuted.\n\nThese Big Tobacco-style tactics \u2013 doubt-mongering, character assassination, intellectual hitjobs, and undisclosed conflicts of interest \u2013 are precisely the sort of product-defense maneuvers that ExxonMobil perfected while attacking climate science and climate scientists. The only difference now is that they are coming after the social sciences, too.\n\nBut it\u2019s hardly the first time. When we published our study, ExxonMobil immediately responded with a straw man, a falsehood, cherry picking, and ad hominem attacks. Last year, they sent a now-leaked memo to Members of European Parliament in an attempt to discredit one of us (Geoffrey Supran) who had been invited to testify to that parliament as an expert witness about the company\u2019s history of climate denial. And for the past three years, ExxonMobil has run a social media campaign accusing us of publishing \u201cmanufactured\u201d science at the behest of \u201ca political campaign.\u201d It has been viewed millions of times.\n\nWith ExxonMobil so evidently offering its critiques in bad faith, we hesitated whether to engage at all. They don\u2019t need to win this debate, they just need to make it seem like there is one. Personally, we don\u2019t care what ExxonMobil says about us. But their attempts to smear our research do matter, because \u2013 in the face of mounting lawsuits, surging public protests and crumbling market value \u2013 ExxonMobil is swinging for a way to discredit the work that demonstrates what they have done.\n\nAlas, it is a swing and a miss. ExxonMobil\u2019s reaction to our work is nothing more than a case in point of the deceptive behavior we described in our original study. ExxonMobil is now misleading the public about its history of misleading the public. Indeed, as Bloomberg\u2019s new report reveals, the company is hiding climate information, too.",

        "article": "Hedgehogs are lactose intolerant. This was the first lesson from my village safari around Kirtlington in Oxfordshire, home to the UK\u2019s longest volunteer-run hedgehog highway. \u201cLeaving out bread and milk is the worst thing you can do,\u201d says resident Chris Powles, who created the highway. It passes through 60 properties in the village, all linked by CD-sized holes cut into fences and walls, some of which have been around since the 18th century.\n\nHedgehogs need space to create territories, forage and find mates. The compartmentalisation of land into private gardens is one of the causes of their disappearance from our landscape \u2013 they have declined by 90% since the second world war. More than 12,000 hedgehog holes have been created as part of the UK\u2019s hedgehog highway network, and Kirtlington has one of the most creative routes on the map. Miniature ramps and staircases thread between gardens in this higgledy-piggledy place, with its 13th-century church and notices about cake sales and \u201ccricketers wanted\u201d.\n\nPowles\u2019s eureka moment came in 2016 when he saw hedgehog faeces in his garden. He started putting down food and then realised his hedgehogs needed somewhere to go other than on to the road, so he knocked a hole in the wall (and made miniature stairs) so they could get into his neighbour\u2019s garden.\n\nEntering Kirtlington; Chris Powles with his map of the hedgehog highway; and watching over the \u2018church\u2019 entrance. Photographs: Tom Pilston/the Guardian\n\nFour years later, his hedgehog map indicates where these nocturnal mammals \u2013 which can walk for a mile each night \u2013 can safely travel. Coloured green are gardens already connected by holes, and in white are future territories to conquer (there are around 75 in total). \u201cWe hardly need a strategy \u2013 the hedgehogs have generated so much enthusiasm. Very few people say no to being involved in the highway,\u201d he says.\n\nPowles has probably been in more gardens than anyone else in the village. \u201cI\u2019ve learned lots of non-hedgehog things about people \u2026 I\u2019m very interested in people\u2019s gardens but I try not to intrude,\u201d he says. We wander through the church, the pub and along public footpaths, enjoying roses and dahlias clinging on to the last of summer\u2019s warmth.\n\nA hedgehog caught on camera using the ramp at Peter Kyte and Zoe Johnson\u2019s house. Photograph: Stephen Powles\n\nPowles asks each person when their last sighting was (numbers have sharply declined recently and it is not clear why) and by the end of the walk we\u2019ve spoken to a dozen people. Talk of hedgehogs comes as easily to residents as comparing notes on the weather. \u201cWith neighbours who have fallen out \u2013 myself included and I won\u2019t say who with \u2013 hedgehogs have brought us back together again. The power of hedgehogs is right there,\u201d he says.\n\nThe highway is an eccentric delight \u2013 stone steps, hedgehog cutouts and little signs like \u201cChurch\u201d for any hedgehog that can read. The ramp at Peter Kyte and Zoe Johnson\u2019s house is 85cm tall and believed to be one of the biggest in the country. Last year the couple put out their night camera and captured visits most nights. \u201cOne or two of them are quite tubby and got stuck at the bottom,\u201d says Peter. One video of a hedgehog using their ramp has been viewed 33,000 times.\n\nMonitoring is an important part of the project. Sticks in front of holes show if hedgehogs have passed (the stick falls down as they walk through). Looking at hedgehog faeces is another useful way to learn about their whereabouts. Eleven camera traps have been distributed around the village by the People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) to help track their movements, and at least half a dozen more have been bought by residents. Isabel Houselander, 10, tells me she thought hedgehogs were imaginary until she saw one outside her front door on the camera trap. She and her two friends now have their own hedgehog holes after being inspired by Powles\u2019s hedgehog presentation at their school.\n\nChris Powles is shown a hedgehog access point by another resident; Lucy Charlesworth, 10, inspects a tunnel; the hole in the gate of the churchyard; a stick left against a hole to monitor movements in and out. Photographs: Tom Pilston/The Guardian\n\nCoordinating the highway has made Powles realise how much people love wildlife and want to help (\u201chere\u2019s another person who\u2019s completely potty about hedgehogs,\u201d he says on a number of occasions). In each garden we stop and have a chat. At one house talk turns to reproduction. \u201cIn terms of the ratio of penis to body weight they\u2019re huge \u2026 if you\u2019re making love to a prickly ball you need something pretty long to get the job done,\u201d says Powles, with dry enthusiasm.\n\nThe initiative is run by the Kirtlington Wildlife and Conservation Society (KWACS), which Powles chairs. The village fete and newsletter (which features hedgehog news) also help fund the holes, which can cost more than \u00a3300 for a thick wall.

It\u2019s an alarmingly familiar picture.\u201d\n\nA lot of the data was used in the RSPB report that found the UK government failed on 17 out of 20 UN biodiversity targets agreed in Japan in 2010. The data was also part of the 2019 State of Nature report, which found that populations of the UK\u2019s most important wildlife had fallen by 60% in 50 years.\n\nThe report showed that in 2018/2019, government funding for UK biodiversity was 0.02% of UK gross domestic product. \u201cOne thing that jumps out is the rather worrying decline in public sector spending on biodiversity,\u201d said Prof Richard Gregory, head of monitoring conservation science for RSPB. \u201cWith the climate and biodiversity crisis, nature-based solutions are part of what we should be doing, so it\u2019s crazy we\u2019re not investing in this.\u201d\n\nNatural England, which is sponsored by Defra, has seen its budget cut by \u00a3180m since 2008, and continued cuts are having a huge impact on the protection of habitats, conservationists warn. \u201cIt\u2019s a real ski-slope decline in funding. Government agencies cannot act to do the really great things they want to do \u2026 They need to put money there to have real action,\u201d said Gregory.\n\nGenerally, habitat \u201cspecialist\u201d species do worse than generalists; farmland birds have declined by 55% since 1970 and woodland birds have declined by 29%. These declines are not just historical \u2013 numbers have continued to drop in the past five years.\n\nThe report did show some improvement in the designation of protected sites, such as an increase in sustainably managed forests and fisheries.\n\nBellever forest in Dartmoor. The report did find improvement in the designation of protected sites. Photograph: Douglas Lander/Alamy\n\nConservationists say that if the new Environment Land Management programme is designed well, it could bring a significant boost to nature funding, but it is not being rolled out until 2024. The issue has been worsened by the significant financial losses many charities have faced and projects being put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis report shows just how far we have to go,\u201d said Green party peer Natalie Bennett. \u201cNot only are we running out of time to tackle the climate emergency, there is also increasingly little time left to reverse this catastrophic decline in nature and wildlife.\u201d\n\nJoan Edwards, director of public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a loss of woodland and farmland birds, long-term decline of pollinators, and the condition of important habitats is deteriorating. We need investment and action on the ground to put nature into recovery and we need it now.\u201d\n\nA Defra spokesperson said the report showed positive signs in terms of the contribution of UK forests in mitigating climate change and the increase in bat populations. \u201cHowever, there remain huge ongoing pressures on the country\u2019s biodiversity, and many of our native species are in decline, which is why we must continue to act to restore and enhance nature.\u201d\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "article": "Largely solitary, nocturnal, venomous and pint-sized, slow lorises are strong contenders for the primates that least resemble humans. Which may be why they are among the least studied, least protected and most poorly understood primates, according to Anna Nekaris, professor of primate conservation and biological anthropology at Oxford Brookes University.\n\n\u201cOut of over 600 primate species, we have five great apes, and everybody wants to study them,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile the plight of orangutans and gorillas has been well publicised, all nine species of slow loris, spread across southern and south-east Asia, are quietly decreasing in number and slipping down the IUCN red list. Philippine, Kayan and Bornean slow lorises are classed as vulnerable; Pygmy, Bengal, Sumatran and Sunda slow lorises are endangered; while Bangkas and Javans are critically endangered.\n\nNekaris (pictured) has been devoted to lorises (there are slender lorises in India and Sri Lanka, too) since 1994, and is on a mission to help them through her research and conservation organisation Little Fireface Project. Spearheading these efforts is a field programme in Java, Indonesia, where she is directing the first long-term study of lorises in the wild.\n\n\u201cIt took about four years before the [local] farmers started taking us seriously,\u201d says Nekaris. Key was teaching children about lorises through a nature club and the Slow Loris Forest Protector programme, making hunting and littering bans matters of local pride, and working with farmers on growing methods and infrastructure to benefit both them and the displaced Javan slow loris.\n\nNekaris says the main threat to the animals has been habitat loss. Java is the most populous island on the planet, with about 130 million people on an island the size of New York state. Little more than 7% of its forests remain. \u201cSomebody\u2019s gone and taken all the tropical hardwoods and sold them for their wood \u2026 There are virtually no lowland rainforests left on Java,\u201d says Nekaris. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle there are any [lorises] at all.\u201d\n\nThe protected national parks are at too high an altitude for naturally forest-dwelling slow lorises. Their home ranges can be 25 hectares (61 acres), but lorises creep rather than leap, and rely on vines in the canopy to get around.\n\n\u201cThe ones we\u2019re studying,\u201d says Nekaris, \u201care living in a human-dominated landscape, in hedgerows around tea, coffee and tomato fields.\u201d While this has made it easier to attach radio collars to study them, says Nekaris, in the absence of joined-up forest the animals have to cross about 200 metres of ground to reach the next clump of trees. \u201cThere are predators such as leopards and dogs, and there are humans trying to catch them,\u201d she says.\n\nA Javan slow loris seen foraging in the canopy\n\nSlow lorises are part of the illegal wildlife trade in Asia. Once they have been captured, their teeth are clipped to ensure they cannot bite and they are sold as cute, docile pets, or used as props for holiday photos in tourist areas. With those vast eyes in teardrop markings, they look like cuddly toys and get a lot of likes on social media.\n\nIn reality, they grow bloated from a poor diet and their eyes fail from light exposure. But unlike the great apes, with their relatable facial expressions, a slow loris\u2019s misery may be hard to spot. When tickled, they shoot their arms up as if enjoying the experience but it is actually a sign of distress. Their cry is ultrasonic, which means it is at too high a frequency for humans to hear.\n\nThe main threat to the slow loris is habitat loss. Java is the most populous island in the world\n\nAs well as their fatal cuteness, slow lorises are believed by some to be the animal that can cure a hundred diseases and are sought after for use in traditional medicines.\n\nTrial and error\n\nIn December 2019, Nekaris published the results of a successful study into whether building a network of bridges could make up for the lack of safe passage in tree canopies and improve the lot of the Javan slow loris. It was a conclusion reached by trial and error.\n\nAt first, Nekaris had installed some ladder-like bridges between trees that were used elsewhere in monkey conservation, but the lorises didn\u2019t take to them. Then she realised that the answer might lie with some of the local farmers\u2019 irrigation pipes. Because of the hilly terrain, some of the pipes were suspended high above ground level, and lorises had been seen crossing them. Nekaris hit on the idea of installing more of them, which would benefit the farmers, too. Twelve days after installation, motion-sensor cameras showed the animals starting to creep across the new pipes.\n\nWhen tracking lorises, Nekaris and her team use a red-filtered torch to avoid disturbing the animals. In the image below, a loris is fitted with a tracking device\n\nNekaris witnessed the animals grow in confidence, she says, \u201cbecause they\u2019re in the air. They\u2019ve increased their home range sizes, and the areas within the home ranges that they can use.\u201d\n\nWith funding from the People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species in the UK, and Cleveland zoo in the US, there are now more than 20 water-pipe bridges in place. The bridges allow the lorises to reach previously inaccessible feeding trees, where they gouge out gum with their teeth. Nekaris also found the lorises could spend less time travelling, more time feeding and, crucially, get enough rest.\n\nAn added benefit of using water pipes is that the farmers have a vested interest in their maintenance. \u201cThe longest bridge is about 400 metres,\u201d says Nekaris. \u201cSome of them have to go over multiple farmers\u2019 lands so you have to negotiate with them to work together.\u201d\n\nGetting the piping to the farms has become, she says, \u201ca community event because people have to bring it up the mountain on motorbike. You have to find the water source to connect it to and then get it to travel where it needs to go. And then the interesting thing was, of course, other farmers started saying, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have slow lorises on my land and I didn\u2019t get a bridge. It\u2019s not fair.\u2019 So then as a contingency, we had to give other people bridges as well, even if they didn\u2019t have lorises.\u201d\n\nNekaris also introduced the idea of shade-grown coffee to the village, growing coffee in its natural habitat of the understory, pollinated by insects, in sustainably fertile soil. Last year, says Nekaris, \u201cwe went with the farming community to a herbarium and picked trees that were useful for the animals but also for fixing nitrogen in the soil and preventing soil erosion and landslides.\u201d They included some \u201ccash\u201d trees, too, \u201cwhich after 10 years could be cut for timber and replaced\u201d.\n\nWater-pipe bridges allow lorises to reach previously inaccessible feeding trees\n\nThere was the extra incentive of certification from the Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network, which involved meeting criteria such as hunting bans, introducing FairTrade and organic practices and boosting habitat through shade-grown crops.\n\nCounting the species: how DNA barcoding is rewriting the book of life Read more\n\nA local ban on hunting endangered species was agreed in September 2019, says Nekaris, \u201cwith all the signs up by October, and that included birds as well\u201d. The villagers agreed to a littering ban, too. \u201cThere\u2019s plastic everywhere,\u201d says Nekaris. \u201cAnd it affects people\u2019s livelihoods all the way down the mountain because it fills the streams that provide their drinking water.\u201d\n\nInterest is growing in a new waste management system, and as this environmental awareness trickles down the mountain, so does the plight of the slow loris. A nearby village is discussing joining the hunting ban. Building bridges for the slow loris, says Nekaris, \u201chas started to build bridges within the community\u201d.\n\nAn added benefit of using water pipes for slow loris bridges is that farmers have a vested interest in maintaining them\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "article": "British supermarkets and brands, including Tesco, the Co-op and Princes, are stepping up action to cut yellowfin tuna catches in the Indian Ocean, amid warnings the stock is in a \u201ccritical\u201d state.\n\nThe effort, by companies reliant on healthy fish stocks, represents a counterintuitive effort to force regulators to act, rather than the other way around.\n\nYellowfin, found in tropical and sub-tropical waters, is widely recognised as being overfished in the Indian Ocean and is listed as \u201cnear-threatened\u201d by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\n\nOn Thursday, the Liverpool-based international food and drinks brand Princes announced it would cut its sourcing of yellowfin in the Indian Ocean by half compared with 2017 levels, to 16,000 tonnes.\n\nPrinces said it hoped the voluntary cut would put pressure on the management body that oversees the stock, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), as well as its member states, fishers and vessels, to introduce cuts to catches ahead of its annual meeting in November.\n\nRetailers and brands have backed repeated calls by NGOs, including the Pew Charitable Trusts and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), for the IOTC to reduce catches of the species in line with scientific advice, amid increasing concerns over overfishing.\n\nNeil Bohannon, group director for fish at Princes, said: \u201cIn recognition of the situation we face, Princes decided to take action to reduce our use of Indian Ocean yellowfin. Our action alone however will not be enough; the IOTC needs to take action and encourage all fleets to reduce catches by 25% from 2017 levels.\u201d\n\nA \u201ccredible recovery plan\u201d was needed to allow stock rebuilding, he said.\n\n\u201cWith our voluntary reduction of Indian Ocean yellowfin in excess of the scientific advice, we are demonstrating our commitment in supporting this recovery.\u201d\n\nThe company, which has two processing sites and 4,000 employees in Mauritius, has been sourcing alternatives to yellowfin since 2017. It has already achieved a 40% reduction, it said. Indian Ocean yellowfin currently accounts for less than 5% of the total Indian Ocean catch.\n\nThe measures follow Tesco\u2019s September announcement that it would stop sourcing yellowfin tuna and billfish from the Indian Ocean if the IOTC fails to implement a recovery plan to rebuild stocks. The retailer said the body\u2019s management practice had been \u201cineffective\u201d. \u201cDeclining tuna populations threaten to impact the entire marine ecosystem,\u201d the company said.\n\nLast month, the Co-op reaffirmed its pledge not to sell any own-brand or branded yellowfin tuna in its stores. It has not sourced yellowfin tuna for seven years.\n\nA report commissioned by the Global Tuna Alliance (GTA), an independent group of retailers and global supply chains working towards sustainable tuna, concluded a 25% reduction in catch levels would be necessary to rebuild the stock within two generations. Yellowfin stock has been overfished in the Indian Ocean since 2016, GTA said, and under management measures by IOTC, many fleets had even increased their catches.\n\nMarcel Kroese, WWF global tuna leader, welcomed the measures taken by Princes. He said: \u201cThe species is in a critical state and a plan to rebuild a healthy stock is urgently needed.\u201d",

        "article": "Vessels spent 200,000 hours in 2019 bottom trawling or dredging the seabed in protected areas set up to safeguard vital ecosystems\n\nMore than 97% of British marine protected areas, created to safeguard ocean habitats, are being dredged and bottom trawled, according to data shared with the Guardian.\n\nNearly a quarter of the UK\u2019s territorial waters are covered by MPAs, set up to protect vital ecosystems and species, including harbour porpoises and dolphins. This network of parks is a symbol of the government\u2019s \u201cworld leading\u201d target to protect 30% of ocean biodiversity by 2030.\n\nHowever, analysis of fishing vessel tracking data from Global Fishing Watch (GFW), by Oceana, a conservation NGO, found that bottom trawling and dredging, the most destructive type of fishing on sea-floor habitats, is happening in 71 out of 73 offshore MPAs around the UK.\n\nThe vessels, from the UK, other EU countries and Russia, spent an estimated 200,000 hours trawling or dredging across the seabed in offshore MPAs in 2019, according to GFW algorithms based on their AIS (automatic identification systems) data, Oceana said.\n\nThe findings, which follow reports by Greenpeace of an increasing number of foreign supertrawlers fishing in the same sites, drew accusations that the government is misleading the public over \u201cpaper parks\u201d that fail to protect Britain\u2019s seas.\n\nThe government has insisted that the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy restricts its ability to implement tougher protections in MPAs. Trawling and dredging is not illegal in most offshore MPAs.\n\nOceana warned of an \u201cecological emergency\u201d, calling on the government to introduce measures to protect the sites from 1 January, the end of the Brexit transition period, when it gains more control of its territorial waters.\n\nThe shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, said the government should publish plans of how it intends to honour its \u201c30 by 30\u201d oceans pledge and hold urgent talks with fishermen.\n\nMelissa Moore, head of policy at Oceana UK, said: \u201cIf the government really want to take back control of our waters, as they repeatedly claim, they should make a policy announcement today that they\u2019ll halt bottom-towed fishing gear by foreign and UK vessels in all marine protected areas. We don\u2019t want more trials, or other measures that merely rearrange the deckchairs, we\u2019re in an ecological emergency and need action now.\u201d\n\nProf Callum Roberts, a marine scientist at Exeter University, said it was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d bottom trawling and dredging was still taking place inside protected sites.\n\nRoberts said: \u201cMPAs are highly ineffective. They are fake, they are paper parks. There\u2019s a massive problem here and the government needs to address it. They are misleading the public, wasting resources, protecting nothing. They are not going to contribute to recovery of marine life, stem the loss of biodiversity or mitigate the impacts of climate change.\u201d\n\nRussian supertrawlers off Scottish coast spark fears for UK marine life Read more\n\nAfter decades of industrial fishing which had destroyed seabed habitats, only a ban on fishing in MPAs would allow marine life to thrive, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate with marine life. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nPollard praised the \u201c30 by 30\u201d pledge, which Michael Gove signed up to when environment secretary. \u201cBut that means ending fishing in MPAs. The government has not been honest enough with the fishing sector,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a timetable, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a plan and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a conversation with the fishing sector about how we can work with fishers to incentivise fishing outside marine protected areas.\n\n\u201cNine years is not very far away.\u201d\n\nConservationists have recently stepped up lobbying to safeguard marine parks. In September, Greenpeace dropped giant boulders from its ship into the Dogger Bank MPA, a North Sea breeding ground for cod, whiting and sand eels, forcing trawlers to avoid the area or risk damaging their fishing gear.\n\nThe Blue Marine Foundation wrote to the fisheries minister, Victoria Prentis, to say it would seek a judicial review unless the government commits to protecting Dogger Bank and other MPAs. A number of NGOs, including WWF and the Marine Conservation Society, also accused the UK, the Netherlands and Germany of breaching the EU habitats directive by failing to protect Dogger Bank from bottom-impact fishing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marine protected areas are intended to conserve the UK\u2019s ecosystems, but have been called \u2018paper parks\u2019 by environmentalists. Photograph: Will Rose/Greenpeace\n\nThere are indications that the government is under pressure to restrict fishing in protected marine sites, although it has to balance the promises it has made to UK fishermen and allow some access to EU boats. Last week, Zac Goldsmith described supertrawlers as \u201cgigantic tools of destruction\u201d and hinted at a ban on industrial fishing inside protected areas.\n\nIn response to Oceana\u2019s analysis, a Defra spokesperson said: \u201cWe are putting sustainable fishing and the protection of our seas at the heart of our future fishing strategy. We have already set up a \u2018blue belt\u2019 of protected waters nearly twice the size of England and the fisheries bill proposes new powers to better manage and control our marine protected areas.\u201d\n\nLeaving the EU and \u201ctaking back control of our waters\u201d means the government can introduce stronger measures, they said.\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cScotland\u2019s marine protected area network is already in excess of 30% of our sea area \u2013 taking Scotland past the proposed new global target for 2030 currently being negotiated by the UN convention on biological diversity \u2013 and each site is managed to achieve its conservation objectives by restricting activity which will hinder this, while allowing sustainable use to continue.\u201d",

        "article": "The mood was joyous among a group of Indigenous fishermen as they hurled lobster traps into the choppy waters of the Atlantic. Moments earlier, they had left a small harbour in eastern Canada, with nearly 200 supporters cheering them on.\n\n\u201cIt was a very exciting and rewarding day for our community and our people,\u201d Sipekne\u2019katik First Nation chief Michael Sack says. \u201cThese were the first licences that we had been issued, and our people were pretty excited to be able to get fishing.\u201d\n\nSince they first set the lobster traps last Thursday, however, that joy has turned to fear and frustration. Indigenous fishermen say they\u2019ve become the target of vandalism and harassment by commercial fishing crews in the area. On Friday, video footage circulated of the Sipekne\u2019katik fishermen having flares shot at them from boats, prompting local chiefs to declare a state of emergency. Days later, a flotilla of nearly 100 boats moved into the bay to haul up the Sipekne\u2019katik lobster traps.\n\nAt issue in Nova Scotia is the right and ability of Indigenous peoples to harvest lobster in their traditional territory and issue their own permits \u2013 something commercial fishermen say contravenes current rules.\n\nFor generations, Indigenous peoples across the country have clashed with the federal government over their right to harvest the land and waters of their ancestors.\n\nA woman wears a face mask recalling a landmark treaty to attend a ceremony in Nova Scotia to bless the fleet last week. Photograph: Canadian Press/REX\n\nThe Sipekne\u2019katik First Nation say their choice to issue their own lobster permits to community members is an expression of treaty rights and point to a landmark supreme court decision from nearly 20 years ago.\n\nAfter activist Donald Marshall Jr was barred from harvesting eel without permits, the country\u2019s highest court affirmed an Indigenous right to fish their lands in the pursuit of a \u201cmoderate livelihood\u201d.\n\nIn a nod to that decision, when the Sipekne\u2019katik First Nation gave out its lobster permits, the first member to receive a licence was Randy Sack, Marshall\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have aligned any better. It was just the perfect scenario, and I\u2019m sure Donald Marshall would be very happy and proud that his son was carrying on his legacy,\u201d says Sack.\n\nBut the court\u2019s decision also came with a subsequent caveat: the federal government has the authority to regulate fisheries in the public interest and for conservation, which has caused confusion and frustration over the years. In the years since, the government has also failed to clearly define \u201cmoderate livelihood\u201d, and how it would apply to Indigenous peoples.\n\nA group representing local fishermen told CBC News they were protesting against \u201can ecological disaster and an onslaught of illegal fishing\u201d, saying they were removing traps from an out-of-season fishery because the federal government has refused to do so.\n\nLegal expert Signa Daum Shanks says framing the fishing as \u201cillegal\u201d is a willful misreading of the obligations both sides have under longstanding treaties.\n\n\u201cSure, the law can be confusing and slow moving at times,\u201d says Shanks. \u201cBut the way in which people are acting, going as far as ramming a boat because they disagree with what is expected under a treaty, it\u2019s just so disappointing. You don\u2019t get to pick and choose which part of a law you follow. And you don\u2019t get to pick and choose which part of a treaty you respect.\u201d\n\nSack also takes issue with the idea that Indigenous fishermen will over-harvest, pointing out that the Sipekne\u2019katik have their own compliance officers to ensure rules are followed.\n\nIf commercial groups are so concerned about conservation, maybe they should limit the number of traps they\u2019re setting Chief Michael Sack\n\n\u201cConservation is one of our biggest worries,\u201d he says, adding that commercial fishermen harvest a far larger share of lobster in the region. \u201cIf the commercial groups are so concerned about conservation, maybe they should limit the number of traps they\u2019re setting.\u201d\n\nThe federal government has granted 979 commercial inshore lobster licences in the area. Sack said his nation had issued seven.\n\nBoth the federal government and police have been watching the situation over the past few days, wary of the growing tensions between the two groups.\n\nSipekne\u2019katik boats gather after opposition from commercial fishermen in Saulnierville, Nova Scotia. Photograph: Ted Pritchard/Reuters\n\nOn Monday, Nova Scotia Mi\u2019kmaq chiefs met the fisheries minister, Bernadette Jordan, and the Indigenous relations minister, Carolyn Bennett. \u201cImplementing the Marshall decision is critical to the work of reconciliation and it is a priority of our government,\u201d Jordan said in a statement last week, but warned that anyone harvesting lobster outside the commercial season could face fines.\n\nWhile Sack is hopeful an agreement with the government will be reached, he\u2019s disappointed that the act of laying traps has kicked off a bitter feud.\n\n\u201cI just wish that they were more understanding of the fact that we have a right to have our own fisheries and to govern our own fisheries,\u201d he says.",

The new evidence supports claims made by the Ecuadorean government last month. The report also found some vessels engaging in potentially suspect transshipment practices, all of which can facilitate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Two squid-fishing boats next to a large vessel, thought to be Chinese-owned, at the edge of Ecuadorian waters.\n\nChina is ranked as the world\u2019s worst nation in a 2019 IUU fishing index.

Workers had told the Guardian their physical and mental health were deteriorating.\n\n\u201cWe are stranded on board for seven months without any salary, and it\u2019s very tough for us because many of us have children, old parents to look after who are also desperately waiting for us,\u201d one of the workers said.\n\nSome of the crew had started a protest on the deck of the luxury cruise ship MSC Poesia to demand their repatriation, with banners that read \u201cEnough is enough\u201d and \u201cSend us home, our lives matter\u201d. Dozens of Mauritian crew also remain stranded on the MSC Musica and the MSC Seaview off the Brazilian port near S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nMSC said it was working hard to repatriate the cruise workers and had provided accommodation, food and medical support to everyone on the ships. It did not comment on the allegations about pay.\n\nThe group were among tens of thousands of cruise ship workers who were left stranded at sea when the pandemic struck, even after passengers were allowed back to land.\n\nThe Mauritian crew have been awaiting repatriation after the island nation reopened its borders at the beginning of June. They fear they have been caught in a blame game between their government, the cruise company and their agency over their repatriation costs.\n\n\u201cSome of our colleagues recently lost their brother and father, which is really very hard to accept and more painful because they could not even see their face for a last time,\u201d a crew member said. \u201cIn this situation our family really needs us.\u201d\n\nOceangoers, the recruitment agency for MSC Cruises in Mauritius, said flights had been booked for the crew this week. But the crew said they would continue their protest until they had received formal confirmation of their journeys. On Sunday, social media posts by some of the crew showed they had halted their protest and had started the journey home.\n\nPockets of cruise ship workers still remain at sea in other parts of the world, including Italy, Dubai and the US. Cruise Lines International Association, the largest trade association for the industry, said it could not give an exact figure as some liners were restarting operations.\n\nBut according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) there are more than 300,000 seafarers and marine personnel who are currently stranded at sea, unable to be repatriated despite the expiry of their contracts.\n\nThe IMO secretary general, Kitack Lim, has warned of a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d at sea and has called for swift action from governments ahead of the UN general assembly.\n\nAn MSC spokesperson said: \u201cOver 75% of our crew, who needed to return home, were safely repatriated by the end of May. And as of today we have now repatriated over 96%.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work hard at every level, directly and through our manning agent on the ground engaging the Mauritian government at the highest level on behalf of our crew.

        "article": "News from around the world\n\nEuropean farmers are on alert after recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan. When bird flu was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe. EU officials have warned poultry producers to step up surveillance against possible outbreaks of avian flu among wild and domestic birds.\n\n\n\nAt least 2.5m million mink are being culled in Denmark after outbreaks of Covid-19 in as many as 63 farms. Denmark is among the largest mink exporters in the world and produces an estimated 17m furs a year, most of which are exported to China. There have also been recent outbreaks on mink farms in the US. After the culling of a million mink on Dutch fur farms over the summer, the Netherlands brought forward its ban on mink farming by three years to 2021. A ban on fur farming has also been proposed in Poland.\n\nMillions of mink are to be culled in Denmark after Covid-19 outbreaks at farms. Photograph: Henning Bagger/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty\n\nUS livestock sector has been given about $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) in US government support during the Covid-19 outbreak. The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program provides financial assistance to farmers to help them cope with lost sales and increased marketing costs associated with the pandemic. So far, more than $1bn has been given to the cattle sector, $600m to dairy and $300m to the pork industry.\n\n\n\nLivestock numbers will not be reduced significantly in the Netherlands, a Dutch government minister promised farmers this month. Environmental groups have called for a reduction in cow and pig numbers in the country, which is struggling to safely dispose of its animal manure. However, agriculture minister Carola Schouten reportedly told farmers she would not agree to a halving of livestock numbers, as some have proposed. Instead, a new report from the Netherlands Environment Agency has called for more efficient production, as well as asking consumers to eat less meat.\n\n\n\nNew Zealand sheep and beef farms are close to being carbon neutral, claim researchers. The study, commissioned by the trade body Beef and Lamb New Zealand, estimates the woody vegetation on New Zealand sheep and beef farms is offsetting between 63% and 118% of their on-farm agricultural emissions.\n\n\n\nOnly two countries \u2013 Finland and Sweden \u2013 have banned routine tail docking in pigs, it has been revealed, despite an EU ban on the practice since 2008. Although most pigs still have their tails docked in the UK, it is only legally allowed as a last resort after improvements to the pigs\u2019 environment and other management options have proved ineffective, or at the recommendation of a vet. A Guardian investigation in Italy last year found 98% of farmers in the main breeding regions \u2013 many of which are destined for the prestigious prosciutto market \u2013 still relied on the practice.\n\nMost pigs in the UK still have their tails docked. Photograph: Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty\n\nNews from the UK\n\nUK supermarket Waitrose has said it will only buy meat, dairy and other food products from net zero carbon farms in the UK by 2035. The National Farmers\u2019 Union had set a target for UK farming to become climate neutral by 2040. It argues that this can be done through growing energy crops to use as biofuel in power stations and capturing carbon dioxide, rather than needing to cut beef or dairy production.\n\nResearchers have criticised US and UK media outlets for a relative lack of coverage of the link between the climate crisis and animal agriculture. A study found that the volume of coverage between 2006 and 2018 remained low, and that when the issue was covered, consumer responsibility was mentioned more than that of governments or large-scale livestock farms.\n\n\n\nCattle exported from Northern Ireland has been shown being slaughtered in the Middle East in sub-standard conditions, according to animal welfare charities. In footage, animals are shown being hacked at repeatedly until they die at a facility in Lebanon, according to Peter Stevenson from the NGO Compassion in World Farming. The cattle are believed to have been sent to Spanish fattening farms, but later resold to the Middle East.\n\nFrom the Animals Farmed series\n\nLivestock farming and water pollution have been in the spotlight over the past month. In Ireland, some scientists fear a surge in milk production is to blame for a fall in the number of pristine rivers and a rise in phosphorus and nitrogen pollution. In Wales, river pollution has led to calls for a moratorium on planning approval for new intensive poultry units. And in France, the country\u2019s largest dairy company is alleged to have polluted the country\u2019s rivers repeatedly over the past decade. The company said the regulations do permit one-off overruns, and these do not necessarily imply that pollution has occurred.\n\n\n\nThere has been worrying news from the US meat sector: pork and poultry with high levels of salmonella and E coli, evidence of aggressive animal abuse and cows being passed off as organic, plus increased fears over worker safety at meat plants.\n\nCattle graze against a blazing backdrop in the Chaco region of Paraguay last week. Photograph: Jorge Adorno/Reuters\n\nMixed news this month from South America, where Brazilian meat giant JBS has pledged to axe suppliers linked to deforestation \u2013 a major turnaround after a period of increased pressure from international investors and other countries. The urgency of the need for change has been highlighted by the wildfires tearing across the region. We have reported on the damage from Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil.\n\n\n\nFarmers are already replacing one of the commodities linked to deforestation: soy. We visited one farm breeding live insects and feeding them to its chickens as an alternative source of protein. The method has brought a host of other benefits, including a reduction in pecking by birds that are instead encouraged to carry out natural foraging behaviours. Meanwhile, UK retailer Marks & Spencer says it has eliminated the use of soy by its dairy farmers after admitting it could not guarantee that soy from deforested areas was not present in its supply chains.\n\n\n\nNine out of 10 EU citizens want their governments to ban the slaughter of animals that have not been stunned, according to the results of a survey, as a legal case against the practice moves through European courts.\n\n\n\nFinally, we had a photo story about how owning goats is transforming and empowering women in Ethiopia and Uganda. For many women, the goats are the first property they have ever owned. \u201cIt used to be only men in my family who owned animals,\u201d said Longoli Paska. \u201cWhen we get more milk we will look for a market and use it to buy more food for the children.\u201d\n\nShare your stories\n\nWe want to hear from you about your experiences and stories from inside the farming industry.

        "article": "France\u2019s largest dairy company has repeatedly polluted the country\u2019s rivers over the past decade, according to a new report by French media organisation Disclose.\n\nDuring a year-long investigation into dairy giant Lactalis, Disclose found that 38 of the company\u2019s production sites in France had breached environmental regulations. In many cases, according to the report, this involved the release into rivers of milk-related derivatives \u2013 which can be deadly to aquatic life in large volumes \u2013 or byproducts from wastewater treatment plants. The report contains evidence of several instances that it says resulted in the death of fish.\n\nAmong the rivers allegedly affected are some of the country\u2019s most famous, such as the Loire, in the area around Saint-Florent-le-Vieil. Others include the V\u00e9ronne in the Auvergne region; the Seiche, which flows through Brittany; and the Is\u00e8re at the gates of the Vercors natural park.\n\n\u201cThe information we have been able to gather reveals a huge environmental pollution scandal,\u201d claimed co-editor-in-chief of Disclose Geoffrey Livolsi, who led the investigation. \u201cThe frequency of the pollution, and the number of industrial sites concerned, raises serious questions about the group\u2019s ability to follow environmental regulations.\n\n\u201cAt some sites, we found that Lactalis had also ignored the administration\u2019s warnings by not initiating the required compliance work \u2013 leaving procedures for several years, exceeding its effluent discharge permits and polluting waterways,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThe Seiche river is cleaned in September 2017 ... one of the rivers allegedly affected by pollution from Lactalis\u2019 production sites. Photograph: Julie Lallou\u00ebt-Geffroy and Kevin Niglaut/Reporterre\n\nDuring the investigation, the activities of 60 of the company\u2019s 70 or so production sites were examined. Of these, more than half appeared to have failed to comply with the regulations of the country\u2019s environmental code at some point between 2010 and today \u2013 with many cases of non-compliance occurring in the last couple of years, the report claims.\n\nAccording to the report, Disclose obtained and analysed hundreds of documents and data from previous court cases and freedom of information requests. In most cases, the report claims, the plants accused of dumping pollutants into rivers were identified by environmental officials. In others, the report refers to evidence obtained via photographs and videos, or from independent water experts.\n\nLactalis describes itself as the worldwide leader in the dairy industry. It owns brands all over the world and employs around 80,000 people in 94 countries, with a turnover of \u20ac18.5bn (\u00a316.8bn).\n\nThe Pr\u00e9sident range from Lactalis is sold in 160 countries. Photograph: Alex Tai/SOPA/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the company said: \u201cLactalis Group\u2019s approach to social and environmental responsibility has intensified over several years, and significant resources are allocated to this continuous improvement process.\u201d\n\nThe company pointed out that the regulations do permit \u201cone-off overruns, and these do not necessarily imply that pollution has occurred\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cThis being said, Lactalis Group acknowledges the existence of temporary non-compliances and has implemented an ambitious investment plan so that these non-compliances do not happen again. For instance, in the past 10 years, many plants have been or are currently involved in a modernisation or replacement programme.\u201d\n\nThe company said it had already invested \u20ac60m in improving its wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe findings come amid renewed focus in France on cleaning up the country\u2019s rivers. In particular, a goal has been set to make the Seine safe to swim in by the time of the Paris Olympics in 2024.\n\nThe publication of Disclose\u2019s report on Monday prompted calls for existing regulations to be tightened up \u2013 and for stronger environmental protections to be put in place.\n\n\u201cThe current regulation and control system for agri-business sites presenting a risk for the environment is totally obsolete and inefficient,\u201d said Suzanne Dalle, who is in charge of agricultural campaigns at Greenpeace France. \u201cIn this case, Lactalis has allowed accidents to multiply in its facilities, with dramatic consequences in terms of water pollution in particular.\n\n\u201cThese organisations put our environment at risk and contribute to climate change. It is urgent to strengthen regulations, controls and associated sanctions.\u201d\n\nAmong the company\u2019s best-known brands is the Pr\u00e9sident range, sold in 160 countries, but it also produces many speciality French cheeses regarded as emblematic of their region.\n\nSign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

        "article": "Claims of violent treatment and cows being passed off as organic have been presented to the Department of Agriculture\n\nEvidence of what appears to be aggressive animal abuse, practices leading to heightened disease risk and cows being passed off as organic at a Texan auctioneers has been presented to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) by undercover welfare investigators. A second, separate abuse investigation at a dairy farm is on its way to court in California.\n\nThe allegations come at a time of upheaval for US dairy. The first half of 2020 was blighted by Covid-19-related milk dumping, 10-year price lows and a slump in demand from schools and restaurants.\n\n\n\nBut by July, a combination of stay-at-home orders, financial handouts to US citizens and government food program purchasing saw the spot cheddar price, a key dairy indicator, set a record high of $3 (\u00a32.30) a pound, according to Tom Bailey, a senior US dairy market analyst at Rabobank.\n\nThe first investigation centres on Texan auctioneers, Erath County Dairy Sales (ECDS). Undercover video footage filmed at ECDS between January and March 2020, and released online on Thursday, was delivered to the USDA by the US-Brazil based NGO, Strategies for Ethical and Environmental Development (Seed).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An undercover investigation at Erath County Dairy Sales in Texas chargers cruelty and criminal activity in the dairy and live animal auction industries.\n\nIn one video, the undercover investigator, hired as an animal handler, is told that removing a cow\u2019s ear tags, and replacing them with new \u201cback tags\u201d that indicate a cow is organic, can triple or quadruple their meat sale value.\n\nIn another clip, the investigator films himself collecting ear tags from the ground. In a third, the undercover operative is told: \u201cOut-of-state cows come in, they turn into Texas cows when they leave.\u201d\n\nThe investigator said he witnessed the tag switching process. First, a bladed tool was used to remove the ear tags, which are part of the USDA\u2019s animal disease traceability framework. These tags were not replaced. Instead, another tag, known as a back tag or sticker, was glued to the cow\u2019s back. The stickers indicate the cow is organic and from Texas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ear tags collected by the undercover worker at ECDS, where it\u2019s alleged tags were switched to pass animals off as organic.\n\nRemoving ID tags from a cow\u2019s ear breaks the link with the animal\u2019s health and veterinary history, the investigator told the Guardian.\n\nA Seed spokesperson said the tags were designed to control disease transmission risks \u2013 between animals and from animals to humans \u2013 linked to factory farms and the movement of animals from farms to auction and slaughterhouses.\n\nThe investigator said one of his greatest concerns was consumers. \u201cI\u2019d imagine people buying this meat with zero traceability, and no idea where it came from, regardless of what\u2019s on the label.\u201d\n\nThe footage also appears to show a cow being kicked in the head and neck area, overcrowded transport conditions, cows with sore legs, or shaking on the ground and lying in puddles, a downed animal repeatedly shocked with a cattle prod and sick and dying cows dumped in a pile together.\n\nProof of the investigator\u2019s time at ECDS includes daily Google Maps location shots, photos of the day\u2019s newspaper, pay cheque stubs and other dated paperwork.\n\nECDS\u2019s majority stockholder and president, Jimmy G Beyer, did not respond to phone calls, messages or emails (via his son) requesting comment. The person answering the phone at the company eventually asked the Guardian to stop calling.\n\n'A savagely broken food system': Cory Booker wants radical reform ... now Read more\n\nA lawyer for California-based NGO, Animal Legal Defense Fund, said she was \u201cnot too surprised\u201d by the tag switching accusations. \u201cWe have seen this type of thing before,\u201d said Kelsey Eberly. She fears the practice is \u201cmore common\u201d than people would expect, mainly \u201cbecause the price premium is so much higher\u201d for organic and better welfare meat and dairy.\n\nEberly is currently taking legal action against the California-based Dick Van Dam Dairy, accusing it of systemic abuse. The lawsuit, filed on 30 September with the California superior court for Riverside County, is based on undercover video footage filmed by Animal Outlook in November 2019.\n\nThe video is narrated by actor Kate Mara. Drawing on the video evidence the lawsuit alleges that Dick Van Dam Dairy supervisors and staff used violence to control the cows.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A dying cow at ECDS, in full view of management and workers, allegedly wasn\u2019t put down until five hours later\n\nViolent handling tactics listed in the lawsuit include: repeatedly jabbing cows\u2019 faces, legs, and udders with splintered wooden canes and metal pipes; kicking them in the face and udders; tail twisting; and poking fingers in cows\u2019 eyes.\n\nThe lawsuit further alleges evidence of teat injuries and blood turning milk pink (which was discarded), and that the bodies of newborn calves were left to decompose.\n\nContacted by the Guardian, the executive vice-president of co-operative Dairy Farmers of America (DFA), Monica Massey, said the DFA does not tolerate animal abuse and had \u201cceased accepting any milk\u201d from the Dick Van Dam Dairy.\n\n'Incredibly dangerous job': concerns safety is slipping at US meat plants Read more\n\nMassey said milk from the dairy was no longer part of its products, DairyPure and TruMoo, and added that although Dick Van Dam was not a DFA member, it had \u201csupplied small amounts of milk\u201d to a California DFA processing facility.\n\nIn an email, the Van Dam family lawyer, Stephen Larson, described the allegations as \u201cmanufactured and false\u201d. He said the \u201cso-called\u201d Animal Legal Defense Fund \u201cwaited nearly a year to even file this publicity-driven lawsuit, which belies their claims of any animals being endangered. The videos and pictures were either staged or are taken wholly out of context, and we look forward to the truth coming out in this lawsuit\u201d.\n\nThe USDA, the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the USDA\u2019s National Organic Program did not respond to requests for comment on either investigation.\n\nA Seed spokesperson said the USDA had confirmed that its Office of Inspector General was investigating the animal cruelty charges at ECDS.\n\n\n\nSign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

        "article": "It\u2019s 10am and the hens are getting excited and bustling around. Jo and Charles Mear are approaching the hutches carrying blue crates and the birds, heads popping up, know what\u2019s inside: black soldier fly larvae or maggots.\n\nWatching chickens peck around for maggots should be utterly normal. Insects are a natural part of a bird\u2019s diet, but most hens today never see one in their lifetime. Instead, they are kept indoors and fed a grain- and soy-rich diet, typically in the form of pellets.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adding black soldier fly larvae to the diets of egg-laying hens reduces the need for soy\n\nBut insects are rich in protein and essential micronutrients. They require less space, produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions and have a high feed conversion rate. And if they could reduce, even in just a small way, the dominance of rainforest-destroying soy as the feed of choice for UK chickens, the benefits could be enormous.\n\n\n\n\u201c[Soy is] our Achilles heel. It\u2019s the best pound for pound source of protein so it\u2019s hard to convince farmers to move away from it,\u201d says Charles.\n\nSoy is our Achilles heel \u2026 it\u2019s hard to convince farmers to move away from it Charles Mear\n\nScientists at the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization certainly believe they can, concluding that insects contain the necessary nutrients, especially protein, to replace between 25\u2013100% of soymeal for chickens. And here, on this chicken farm in Cambridgeshire, an experiment is being carried out that might bring that reality a little closer.\n\nThe Mears keep around 28,000 birds across two barns in Cambridgeshire, supplying branded free-range eggs to the Co-op, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Tesco. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to produce a more sustainable \u2018over the hedge\u2019 farm here where we source everything we need as locally as possible. So finding a way to replace soy has been the next step for us,\u201d says Charles.\n\n\n\nThat opportunity presented itself when by chance he heard about two Cambridge graduates who had recently founded the insect startup Better Origin. \u201cWith the guys being so close by I just said to them to come and use our farm to trial the insects,\u201d says Charles.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Charles and Jo Mear run a free-range egg farm in Cambridgeshire, keeping around 28,000 birds\n\nIn March they began hosting the UK\u2019s first AI-powered insect mini farm in a shipping container unit, growing larvae using food waste. The specialised insect-breeding unit was built off-site and delivered straight to the farm. Batches of maggot eggs arrive every few days, and the insects are reared in an automated setup that tracks their growth using thermal cameras and AI. All Charles and Jo need to do is keep the unit supplied with energy and waste feedstocks.\n\nThe larvae grow rapidly: \u201c5,000 times its body mass in less than a couple of weeks\u201d, according to Better Origin\u2019s co-founder Fotis Fotiadis, and happily live off food and crop waste. After two weeks they are ready to be fed to the hens, and a new cycle of eggs is delivered to the farm to maintain a continuous supply of insects.\n\nThe results have been unequivocally positive, say the Mears. The birds \u2013 a wonderfully healthy and energetic flock \u2013 love it: they\u2019ve worked out the time of the day when blue containers of maggots, rather than ready-made feed, arrive, and get particularly excited when they see them coming.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Miha Pipan (left) and Fotis Fotiadis (right) co-founded the insect startup Better Origin in 2014\n\nIt has also encouraged the hens to carry out natural foraging behaviours, says Charles, who has noticed that as a result they seem less inclined to peck other birds. \u201cEven after the maggots are all gone they carry on looking and stay active doing little scratch dances, which is really healthy for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt also brings a reduction in floor eggs [eggs laid on the floor which are downgraded by retailers and not able to be sold as fresh eggs]. As they are looking for food they don\u2019t feel comfortable laying eggs out and about in the communal areas so go back to their nesting boxes to lay eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally improved welfare outcomes come at a cost to productivity, but that\u2019s not the case with feeding live insects,\u201d says Fotiadis. \u201cThis is what chickens have evolved for millions of years to do, hunting and pecking around for their food.\u201d\n\nThis is what chickens have evolved for millions of years to do, hunting and pecking around for their food Fotis Fotiadis, Better Origin\n\nFeeding live insects has also been found to have a positive effect on the birds\u2019 immune systems \u2013 the Mears haven\u2019t used antibiotics on their farm this year \u2013 offering the potential to reduce antibiotic use, which continues to rise in the poultry sector.\n\nFor now, the ambition is to replace 5% of the birds\u2019 soy-based diet with insects. And while the welfare and environmental benefits are already clear, the main selling point for farmers is economics, says Fotiadis, who calculates that supplementing diets with live insects can add 80p\u2013\u00a31 per hen of profit per year.\n\n\u201cWe know there are welfare benefits, but these are hard to monitor. But we can prove to the rest of the farming industry the financial benefit of incorporating insects. It increases productivity (the birds produce more eggs), the quality of the eggs (less floor eggs) and improves feather cover (poor feather cover is linked to the need for more feed). It works for the farmer and makes them more money,\u201d he says.\n\nHe and his team, who are installing a second insect-rearing unit on a chicken farm in Wales next month, have also tracked a 3% increase in shell strength in the hens\u2019 eggs due to the rich source of calcium provided by the black soldier fly larvae.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Insects eggs are delivered to the farm and housed inside a shipping container unit\n\n\u201cThis type of larvae is a missing link in the food chain. In nature there is no waste. The apple rots and is either absorbed by the soil or eaten and converted into nutrients by larvae. We take wasted nutrients and put them back into the food chain. It\u2019s closer to nature and a much better way of farming,\u201d says Fotiadis.\n\n\n\nBack on the farm, Charles Mear can\u2019t get enough of seeing how much his hens are enjoying the insects. \u201cPsychologically, the hen always wants to go out and scratch about to loosen the soil and look for grub. I just love coming and seeing them itching to get out of the shed and look for it [the larvae] now they know it is going to be there.\u201d\n\n\n\nSign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.
